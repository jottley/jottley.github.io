We are moving from CMIS 1.0 atompub bindings to CMIS 1.1 browser bindings. I’ve worked out how to do a DELETE and wanted to document an example that others could extrapolate from.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A browser binding DELETE should follow the model of a form POST according to the documentation. Playing around with the provided examples (there were no DELETE examples that I found doing a quick google search) I found it to be a simpler than a form POST. I should also note that these calls are governed by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy&quot; title=&quot;Same Origin Policy&quot;&gt;same origin policy&lt;/a&gt; so you’ll need to use either &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP&quot; title=&quot;JSONP&quot;&gt;JSON-P&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing&quot; title=&quot;Cross-origin resource sharing&quot;&gt;CORS&lt;/a&gt; enabled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slideshare.net/jottley/cors-enable-alfresco-for-cors&quot; title=&quot;CORS enable Alfresco&quot;&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; to enable building applications against the CMIS enabled repository.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I’m using curl for my examples.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are two ways to address the object that you want to delete: using the objectId or by path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-objectid&quot;&gt;Using objectId&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To delete by objectId we need to include the ‘objectId=’ parameter along with cmis objectId (ex. 7ab93c6a-9520-40dd-be74-bae52f4bd6ca;1.0).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;objectId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;7ab93c6a-9520-40dd-be74-bae52f4bd6ca&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;1.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;by-path&quot;&gt;By Path&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To delete by path you need to include the full path in the URL. There is no need to include the objectId in the by path call as the path has precedence over the objectId&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;Sites/internal2/documentLibrary/test.txt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now with the basics of addressing the document or folder under our belt we can pull together the rest of the call.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With the atompub binding we made a delete using the HTTP DELETE method. With the browser binding a delete is made using the HTTP POST method. To indicate our call is a delete we add the ‘cmisaction=’ parameter with a value of delete to our call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;cmisaction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;delete
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A full objectId call (made against Alfresco Cloud) would use a URL like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;https://api.alfresco.com/ottleys.net/public/cmis/versions/1.1/browser/root?cmisaction&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;delete&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;objectId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;804f6300-38cd-48a4-86db-499f58497ae5&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;1.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same call using a path:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;https://api.alfresco.com/ottleys.net/public/cmis/versions/1.1/browser/root/Sites/internal2/documentLibrary/test.txt?cmisaction&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;delete
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the objectId example from above a call using curl against the Alfresco Cloud Public API would look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;curl -X POST &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;https://api.alfresco.com/ottleys.net/public/cmis/versions/1.1/browser/root?cmisaction=delete&amp;amp;objectId=804f6300-38cd-48a4-86db-499f58497ae5;1.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; --header &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Authorization:Bearer 42b8c319-344c-4273-b94c-b4c23482be6b&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; -IL
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For those unfamiliar with curl I’ve added the -IL options to the command so that I can see details about the response (not including the body).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-about-response-codes&quot;&gt;What about response codes?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With atompub a successful delete would have resulted in a 204 response code and no response body. With the browser bindings a 200 response code is returned still with no body. (My preference would be that it returned a 204. This would keep consistency across the bindings and would match what I believe is proper DELETE response.)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And response codes for Errors? You still see a 401 when a user needs to authenticate and a 404 if the object can’t be found. All other errors that I saw came back as 409s. This includes locked documents and attempting to delete folders containing children. If you receive a 409 result there are two json values you can look at to find the reason for the error: exception (the short description) and message (a fuller description of the error).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is possible to merge maps of a child bean to a parent bean. Here is how it is done: Create a new bean, where the parent is the &lt;code&gt;applicationScriptUtils&lt;/code&gt; bean. Add a single property of &lt;code&gt;decoratedProperties&lt;/code&gt; and define a map in the property. When you define the map add the attribute &lt;code&gt;merge=&quot;true&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Finally, add your custom property to decorator bean mappings. Done!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;

Add a Workflow

As discussed in </summary><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Continuing on from my previous post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/alfresco/alfresco-simple-workflow&quot; title=&quot;Alfresco: Simple Workflow&quot;&gt;Simple Workflows&lt;/a&gt; let’s look at using the Simple Workflow model in a few web scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first web script will add a simple workflow to a node. The second will allow us to signal the transition of accept or reject on that node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add a Workflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As discussed in the previous post, a simple workflow is made up of two paths: accept or reject with a copy or move to another folder. You are also able to set the name presented to the user for the accept or reject step. This is very useful as what we may be presenting to the user is to not accept or reject documents, but rather sending the document to two different group owned folders based on context/content of those documents. At least one step is required. Alfresco defaults “accept” for the required step and makes “reject” the optional step. These need to be passed to our web script. The payload is passed as json. A full example of this looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;{
    &quot;simpleworkflow&quot;: {
        &quot;accept&quot;: {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;acceptstep&quot;,
            &quot;move&quot;: true,
            &quot;folder&quot;: &quot;workspace://SpacesStore/ebd7ff99-b423-4e45-ad4f-71929ce4c089&quot;
        },
        &quot;reject&quot;: {
            &quot;name&quot;: &quot;rejectstep&quot;,
            &quot;move&quot;: true,
            &quot;folder&quot;: &quot;workspace://SpacesStore/0239b2ed-ebfa-4b9d-a7fa-f0404448cffc&quot;
        }
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the above example, the reject object is optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the accept and reject objects are made up of the three required values of the simple workflow aspect: name, move and folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The name field maps to either approveStep or rejectStep. It is the name presented in the Alfresco UIs. But it could also be used in a custom interface as they are returned as part of the list of properties for the node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move field maps to either approveMove or rejectMove. This boolean field indicates with a true value to move the node or, if false, to copy the node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final field, folder, maps to approveFolder or rejectFolder. This is the folder node where the document should be moved or copied to when the appropriate action is taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web script can be call by passing the simpleworkflow json object to &lt;code&gt;simpleworkflow/add/{store_type}/{store_id}/{id}&lt;/code&gt;. Upon completion a json object of &lt;code&gt;{ &quot;success&quot;: true|false] }&lt;/code&gt;. True upon successful completion, false if there was an error adding the simpleworkflow aspect to the node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a Simple Workflow from a Web Script&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This web script was originally developed for a customer to return XML, but I’ve now updated it to return json by default. The XML is maintained here for backwards compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a simple workflow aspect is added to a node, it just adds the properties of what should occur when an accept or reject action is taken. The actual actions of what happens is built into UIs. So the web scripts need to do the same: perform the copy or move to the targeted folder. The call is pretty simple: &lt;code&gt;simpleworkflow/{accept|reject}/{store_type}/{store_id}/{id}&lt;/code&gt;. The json or XML that is returned let us know of either the success or the failure of this action. Failures can provide some information on why the failure occurred. A success messages, provides more detail: what action occured — copy or move, which step was taken — returning the name as set in the approveStep or rejectStep properties, the folder that document was moved or copied to. The destination that is returned is the human readable path. (If there is any interest we can update this to return the nodeRef as well as the path.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The json returned looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;{
    &quot;success&quot;: true,
    &quot;action&quot;: &quot;move&quot;,
    &quot;step&quot;: &quot;acceptStep&quot;,
    &quot;destination&quot;: &quot;/Company Home/Sites/workflow/docmentLibrary/workflow/accept&quot;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These web scripts can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-simple-workflow-webscripts/&quot;&gt;downloaded&lt;/a&gt; from its Google Code Project.&lt;/p&gt;

It was usually something that enabled the prospect to tick off a major requirement on their long list of things that the solution they were looking for needed. Alfresco has two kinds of workflow: simple and for lack of a better word advanced. Advanced workflows usually require some level of business logic, multiple steps, several actors, etc. Advanced workflows are implemented using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.activiti.org/&quot;&gt;Activiti&lt;/a&gt; (Alfresco 4.0 forward) or JBPM (pre Alfresco 4.0 and maintained for legacy in Alfresco 4.0) Simple workflows provide an accept, a reject, and then the content is either copied or moved to another folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I really like about simple workflows is how they are implemented and how you can model your own customizations or applications using this pattern. As a follow up to this post I’m going to share a web script to add a simple workflow to a node and then another to progress the workflow by accepting or rejecting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s dig in!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple workflows present, as stated above, the ability to accept and reject the document and then copy or move that document to another space. The key to a simple workflow is the model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;aspect name=&quot;app:simpleworkflow&quot;&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;parent&amp;gt;app:workflow&amp;lt;/parent&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;properties&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;property name=&quot;app:approveStep&quot;&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;d:text&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;protected&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/protected&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;property name=&quot;app:approveFolder&quot;&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;d:noderef&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;protected&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/protected&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;property name=&quot;app:approveMove&quot;&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;d:boolean&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;property name=&quot;app:rejectStep&quot;&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;d:text&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;protected&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/protected&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;property name=&quot;app:rejectFolder&quot;&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;d:noderef&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;protected&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/protected&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;property name=&quot;app:rejectMove&quot;&amp;gt;
               &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;d:boolean&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;/properties&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/aspect&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each node that has a simple workflow attached to it has this aspect applied to it, which specifies through properties what steps are available, what that step should be called (acceptStep and rejectStep) and then what should occur when that step is taken: should it be moved or copied (acceptMove and rejectMove)? and where it should go (acceptFolder and rejectFolder).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing this opens many doors for us. Because the steps are properties on the node, we can modify them, if needs be, using either javascript or Java. We can also build on top of this. When I worked on the Consulting team at Alfresco a customer wanted to have a three step workflow: accept, reject and other. Modeling this was simple. All we really needed to do was add three simple properties: the step name (text), the destination node (noderef) and if it is a move or copy (boolean). A bit more complex was adding the logic for exposing this through the Explorer UI. (This customer had not yet moved to Share). Because we did not want to affect all of the simple workflows already in place, we opted to add an additional 3 step simple workflow, giving them the ability to have up to 5 different paths that could be taken for a single node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also tie simple workflows into more complex actions: dynamically adding simple workflows or scripting more complex actions that allow users to manually take the workflow steps but also allowing programatic lifecycle or state to take simple workflow actions. By jumping out of Explorer or Share and into a custom application you can expose simple workflows from the repository through a web script (an easier task than modifying JSF) and one that I’ve used for several different Alfresco implementations. We will cover that in my next post.&lt;/p&gt;

You should really check out their excellent example if you need a full example of writing scheduled jobs for Alfresco.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that is easy to forget when adding/writing a new scheduled jobs is to wrap your code in a RetryingTransactionHelper _and_ a RunAs. When executing the scheduled job we need to make sure that we provide a transaction in which to perform your custom code and a user to perform the code under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;public void execute()

            @Override
            public Object doWork()

                RetryingTransactionCallback&amp;lt;;Object&amp;gt;; txnWork = new RetryingTransactionCallback&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt;()

                    public Object execute()
                        throws Exception
                    {
                        //Add logic here
                        return null;
                    }
                };

                transactionService.getRetryingTransactionHelper().doInTransaction(txnWork, false);
                return null;
            }
        }, user_authority);

    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this template will prove usefully to anyone writing a custom scheduled actions.&lt;/p&gt;

So without further ado….&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the exciting, at least in my opinion, new features of Alfresco 4 is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.alfresco.com/wp/mikeh/2011/09/26/share-document-library-extensions-in-v4-0/&quot;&gt;Share Document Library Extension’s&lt;/a&gt; (hat tip to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/#!/mikehatfield&quot;&gt;Mike Hatfield)&lt;/a&gt;.  In the above post Mike goes in to detail on how to use this new feature and I’m going to share an example on how I’m using it as part of integration with Dropbox I’m working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem-set&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem Set&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the integration we need to add a status indicator (see the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.alfresco.com/wp/mikeh/2011/09/26/share-document-library-extensions-in-v4-0/&quot;&gt;above article &lt;/a&gt;for in depth details on status indicators) to, as the name states, indicate that the file/folder is in a specific state, ie synced to Dropbox.  Early on this was a simple tasks: does it have a specific aspect or not.  As the project has moved forward, we’ve raised the complexity: does it have a specific association and does that association have a child association of a specific value…a direct correlation between this child association and a specific user.  Now that we have moved beyond what the out of the box evaluators can do directly, what are our options?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;options&quot;&gt;Options?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Share Document Library Extension Framework provides two options for retrieving additional metadata/values from the repository tier: Custom Responses and Property Decorators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Custom Responses allow you to return information that is not specific to any node.  Alfresco 4 uses this to return information about our Sharepoint Protocol integration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Property Decorators allow you to return node specific information in a more usable format to the web tier (ie Share).  For example rewriting a nodeRef to a filename, or a username as first and last name. Or as in our case, a new set of properties or key/value pairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are looking for specific information about a node, a property decorator is what we will need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;implemention&quot;&gt;Implemention&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A property decorator needs to have the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A content model property to hold a map of properties. In our model we added a property similar to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;property name=&quot;alf:propertyHolder&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;type&amp;gt;d:boolean&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;default&amp;gt;false&amp;lt;/default&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;index enabled=&quot;false&quot;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This property will never be needed in the index since it will always be the same value until it is requested in Share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we need to implement our logic.  This requires a new Java class that implements PropertyDecorator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;public class CustomProperty
    implements PropertyDecorator
{

  //Add any needed services

    @Override
    public Serializable decorate(NodeRef nodeRef, String propertyName, Serializable value)
    {
        Map&amp;lt;String, Serializable&amp;gt; map = new LinkedHashMap&amp;lt;String, Serializable&amp;gt;(4);

        //Add logic here

        //One to many
        map.put(&quot;key&quot;, value);

        return (Serializable)map;
    }

}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also requires a new Spring bean definition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;bean id=&quot;customProperty&quot; class=&quot;org.alfresco.extension.repo.jscript.app.CustomProperty&quot;&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;!-- Any needed service --&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly we need to add it to the list of propertyDecorators.  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve add a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/alfresco/alfresco-property-decorators-cont&quot; title=&quot;Alfresco: Property Decorators — cont.&quot;&gt;new post&lt;/a&gt; that covers how the mapping should occur and added a new bean here.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;del datetime=&quot;2012-04-02T20:26:51+00:00&quot;&gt;Currently this requires overwriting the out of the box definition for applicationScriptUtils.  This could cause issues if you have several different AMPs that need to overwrite this bean. (I’ve opened ALF-13038 for this issue).&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;bean id=&quot;customApplicationScriptUtils&quot; parent=&quot;applicationScriptUtils&quot;&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;property name=&quot;decoratedProperties&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;map merge=&quot;true&quot;&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;entry key=&quot;alf:propertyHolder&quot;&amp;gt;
          &amp;lt;ref bean=&quot;customDecoratorBean&quot;/&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;/entry&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/map&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this completes the repo side of our extension.  Now we need to work with the values returned on the Share side.  We needr a status indicator so we’ll focus there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First we’ll define the evaluator.  We need to add the evaluator to &lt;code&gt;web-extension/custom-slingshot-something-context.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;bean id=&quot;evaluator.doclib.indicator.custom&quot; parent=&quot;evaluator.doclib.metadata.value&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;property name=&quot;accessor&quot; value=&quot;properties.customProperty&quot;/&amp;gt;
	  &amp;lt;property name=&quot;comparator&quot;&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;bean class=&quot;org.alfresco.web.evaluator.StringEqualsComparator&quot;&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;property name=&quot;value&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/property&amp;gt;
   &amp;lt;/bean&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that the value of the accessor is not the content model property name, but the key value used in our map from the CustomProperty class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, we use the evaluator in our indicator config. This is added to our &lt;code&gt;share-config-custom.xml&lt;/code&gt; under the &lt;code&gt;META-INF&lt;/code&gt; in our custom jar file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;config evaluator=&quot;string-compare&quot; condition=&quot;DocumentLibrary&quot;&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;indicators&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;indicator id=&quot;customDecorator&quot; index=&quot;250&quot; icon=&quot;custom-16.png&quot;&amp;gt;
				&amp;lt;evaluator&amp;gt;evaluator.doclib.indicator.custom&amp;lt;/evaluator&amp;gt;
			&amp;lt;/indicator&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;/indicators&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/config&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Share Document Library Extension Framework is a powerful new tool in the developer toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-what-are-we-trying-to-accomplish&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what are we trying to accomplish?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Share Site Discussion Components supports the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Threaded Discussions &amp;#8211; Post topic and replies
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      Dynamic Filtering &amp;#8211; Tags/New/Hot/All/My Topics
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      RSS Feed for latest discussions
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notifications of new posts can happen over RSS and to the Site Activities Dashlet both of which require access to the system, most likely behind a firewall.  Email notifications can provide updates the don’t require direct access to the system, unless you are looking to update the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;where-to-start&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where to start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that we need to know as we get started. First, when a site is created in Alfresco Share, the content nodes supporting discussions are not created.  Only after a user accesses the discussion component does it get created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, discussions are created as &lt;code&gt;fm:topic&lt;/code&gt; types.  Posts are added as children of &lt;code&gt;fm:topic&lt;/code&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;fm:post&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-a-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to add notifications is as a rule via the Alfresco Explorer client on the discussion space that is created for the site, under the Sites space.  Adding a rule to the disucssions space matching all content items will result on two emails (one for the creation of the topic and one for the first post).  So we  need to be more specific: We need to expose the Forum Post and  Topic types as Subtypes to the rules engine.  You add fm:topic as well if you want to enable delete notifications&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To &lt;code&gt;web-client-config-custom.xml&lt;/code&gt; add&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: xml; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;alfresco-config&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;config evaluator=&quot;string-compare&quot; condition=&quot;Action Wizards&quot;&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;subtypes&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;type name=&quot;fm:post&quot;/&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;type name=&quot;fm:topic&quot;/&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/subtypes&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;/config&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/alfresco-config&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Topics are the best choice for building rules on.  Notifications on &lt;code&gt;fm:topic&lt;/code&gt; will work for create and delete but not update.  The title of a topic is stored on the first post of a discussion.  You can’t delete individual posts but you can delete a Topic so when specifying a delete notification it can be made directly against a topic,but again…it is easier to just do the same using fm:post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The notification template would be added to email templates and would look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: plain; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;A new post is available in the &apos;${document.parent.childAssocs[&quot;cm:contains&quot;][0].properties.title}&apos; dicussion in the &apos;${document.parent.parent.parent.properties.name}&apos; site, it was added by ${person.properties.firstName}&amp;lt;#if person.properties.lastName?exists&amp;gt; ${person.properties.lastName}&amp;lt;/#if&amp;gt;.

You can view it through this link:
${url.serverPath}/share/page/site/${document.parent.parent.parent.properties.name}/discussions-topicview?topicId=${document.parent.children[0].name}&amp;amp;listViewLinkBack=true
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;email-notification-rule&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email Notification Rule&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An email rule is simple to setup but the maintenance cost can be high.  You have to add each user/group manually and Share site groups are not visible to the Explorer client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next option is to script the notification.   A Share site group or dynamically build email list of those participating in the discussion.  (A nice to have would be to build in a watch option for those who may not participate in the discussion but want to be notified.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mail-action-sample-for-group-or-individual&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail action sample for group or individual.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;to_many&lt;/code&gt; paramater currently only supports one group at a time….if you need to send to multiple people or groups, you’ll need to loop over the &lt;code&gt;to_many&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; paramaters and execute against each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;var siteGroup = &quot;GROUP_site_&quot; + document.parent.parent.parent.name;
var template = &quot;Data Dictionary/Email Templates/Notify Email Templates/share_discussion_notification.ftl&quot;;

// create mail action
var mail = actions.create(&quot;mail&quot;);
mail.parameters.to_many = siteGroup;
//mail.parameters.from (with no from address provided the email address of the user triggering the action is used)
mail.parameters.subject=&quot;New Post in Discussion: &quot;+document.parent.childAssocs[&quot;cm:contains&quot;][0].properties.title;
mail.parameters.template = companyhome.childByNamePath(template);

//execute action against a document
mail.execute(document);
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This option also will send email to all users in a group…even if their account has been disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option when scripting is to dynamically build the notification list  – send only to those that are part of the discussion.  You can walk the posts through the Child Associations of the topic to build an array of users.  For smaller discussion threads there will not be that high of a cost. (Small here is a relative term, as I don’t have any metrics to say what is small).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;var emailAddresses = [];

//for p expresion variable
var p, e, a;

//change to use your template
var template = &quot;Data Dictionary/Email Templates/Notify Email Templates/share_discussion_notification.ftl&quot;;

function getEmail(person) {
	var personNode = people.getPerson(person);
	return personNode.properties.email;
}

// build emailAddresses
for (p = 0; p &amp;lt; document.parent.childAssocs[&quot;cm:contains&quot;].length; p += 1) {
	var user = document.parent.childAssocs[&quot;cm:contains&quot;][p].properties.creator;
	var email = getEmail(user);

	//Is the emailAddress already in the array? If not, add it
	if (emailAddresses.length &amp;gt; 0) {
		var match = false;
		for (e = 0; e &amp;lt; emailAddresses.length; e += 1) {
			if (emailAddresses[e] === email) {
				match = true;
				break;
			}
		}

		if (!match) {
			emailAddresses.push(email);
		}
	} else {
		emailAddresses.push(email);
	}
}

// create mail action
var mail = actions.create(&quot;mail&quot;);
mail.parameters.subject = &quot;New Post in Discussion: &quot; + document.parent.childAssocs[&quot;cm:contains&quot;][0].properties.title;
mail.parameters.template = companyhome.childByNamePath(template);

//send an email for each address
for (a = 0; a &amp;lt; emailAddresses.length; a += 1) {
	mail.parameters.to = emailAddresses[a];
	//execute action against a document
	mail.execute(document);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another option would be to add an aspect to the topic that stores a collection of all the users who have participated in the thread.  (You could also add a place to collect watchers, but you’d also need to extend the UI to allow you to capture the users for this list.)  The aspect would be added on creation on a new topic. (Use Usernames, so that you can avoid  any issues with email addresses changing — Usernames are unmutable).  When a user adds a post, their email address is added to the collection for notification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;var creator = document.properties.creator;

//for expresion variable
var u, a;

//change to use your template
var template = “Data Dictionary/Email Templates/Notify Email Templates/share_discussion_notification.ftl”;

function getEmail(person) {
	var personNode = people.getPerson(person);
	return personNode.properties.email;
}

//Look for match in n:users, if no match add them other wise, ignore the user
function updateUsers(user) {
	if (document.parent.properties[&quot;n:users&quot;] === null) {
		document.parent.properties[&quot;n:users&quot;] = [];
		document.parent.properties[&quot;n:users&quot;].push(user);
		document.parent.save();
	} else {
		var match = false;

		for (u = 0; u &amp;lt; document.parent.properties[&quot;n:users&quot;].length; u += 1) {
			if (document.parent.properties[&quot;n:users&quot;][u] === user) {
				match = true;
				break;
			}
		}

		if (!match) {
			document.parent.properties[&quot;n:users&quot;].push(user);
			document.parent.save();
		}
	}
}

//Check for notifiable aspect
if (document.parent.hasAspect(&quot;n:notifiable&quot;) {

	//if the user is not already in the n:users property of the notifiable aspect, add them
	updateUsers(creator);

	//create mail action
	var mail = actions.create(“mail”);
	mail.parameters.subject = “New Post in Discussion: ” + document.parent.childAssocs[&quot;cm:contains&quot;][0].properties.title;
	mail.parameters.template = companyhome.childByNamePath(template);

	//send an email for each user in n:users
	for (a = 0; a &amp;lt; document.parent.properties[&quot;n:users&quot;].length; a += 1) {
		mail.parameters.to = getEmail(document.parent.properties[&quot;n:users&quot;][a]);

		//execute action against a document
		mail.execute(document);
	}
} else {
	logger.log(&quot;The notifiable aspect has not been added to the topic: &quot; + document.parent.name;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These options should also take into account disabled accounts: (&lt;code&gt;person.isAccountEnabled(userName);&lt;/code&gt; The problem with this is that &lt;code&gt;isAccountEnables&lt;/code&gt; requires admin privileges.  There is no runAs for this kind of javascript so implementing this would require implementing the action in Java, which is outside the scope of this exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, I’ve given you some ideas of ways to approach adding discussion notifications.  The key here in discovering how to approach this was knowing where to look at how discussions are stored in the repository.  In fact this is the key for most any extension to Alfresco:  Asking yourself how does this work for this feature, which is similar to what I need, work in Alfresco? Understanding how this is pulled together from looking at the content model, looking at actual content/nodes through the node browser, understanding the relationships between nodes: parent/child and peer and sometimes digging into the source code can help to expand your understanding when looking to extend Alfresco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today almost the entire family is sick so I thought I’d pick up the project again, moving the Java class to a Java Backed web script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web script is a simple GET that takes the nodeRef of two files, or two versions of the same file and outputs a simple HTML page that highlights the differences between the two.  There are no complex algorithms that take into account shifts in blocks or identifies just the text in a line that has changed.  It is a simple line by line comparison of two pieces of content. It is not integrated in to Share or Explorer at this time.  I might take that as a separate sick day project (or accept any code contributions to add that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll admit right off that the code is ugly and repetitive.  But this is more of a Proof of Concept than a full production ready implementation (though it could definitely be used as such to provide a quick view of differences).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve also probably bored you with the above so let’s just jump right in before I completely lose you… &lt;img src=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;;-)&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-the-web-script&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using The Web Script&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web script is called by the following URL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;alfresco/service/file/{protocol_1}/{identifier_1}/{id_1}/diff/{protocol_2}/{identifier_2}/{id_2}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For real world examples we’ll first look at comparing two files&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;alfresco/service/file/workspace/SpacesStore/dd83c9f6-81b7-462b-8a1a-1e9a2af251dd/diff/workspace/SpacesStore/ca65d129-6c2c-4ba0-936d-d7626f94f23a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second comparing two versions of the same file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;alfresco/service/file/workspace/SpacesStore/dd83c9f6-81b7-462b-8a1a-1e9a2af251dd/diff/versionStore/version2Store/ca65d129-6c2c-4ba0-936d-d7626f94f23a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is returned is, as stated above, a simple HTML highlighting the differences&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-28-at-4.46.07-PM.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[416]&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-417&quot; src=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-28-at-4.46.07-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;582&quot; height=&quot;197&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each line that is different is highlighted in blue.  Simple and to the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-code&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a little Declarative Web Script that reads the content line by line and then compares the hash of each line to see differences.  When a difference is found it is wrapped in HTML to annotate the difference so that when displayed, CSS can take care of highlighting the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of things that I think are important to note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File length:&lt;/strong&gt; When comparing two files there is always the possibility that one is longer/shorter than the other.  To simplify the comparison, I just append lines with a single space to the shorter file, simplifying any computational work needed for the comparison caused by the difference in length. 
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I mentioned above that the appended line contains a single space.  This is done so the that the line appears in the output.  &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; tags with no content can be ignored by some browsers. The annotation/presentation uses a combination of &amp;lt;div&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; tags.  The space is maintained in a &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; tag forces the div element to be visible.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;**Special Characters: **Because the output for the comparison is targeted for HTML, it is important to escape all characters/strings that could be interpreted by the browser as presentation elements.  Apache Commons (included with Alfresco) has classes to help do this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gotcha!:&lt;/strong&gt; When I was initially testing the code, the file content kept appending files to the previous request.  So remember when defining a Collection as a class scoped variable to call clear() on the List to make sure it is empty before it gets reused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension is available as an &lt;a href=&quot;http://alfresco-simple-file-diff.googlecode.com/files/alfresco-filediff-webscript-0.1.amp&quot;&gt;AMP&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;So I took sometime this evening to add in one of my planned actions: Insert PDF.  This action allows you to insert a PDF into another PDF at a specific page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty straight forward action to test:  From the Document Details page of the PDF you want to insert content into, select Run Action (This action can also be run through the rules engine or scripted).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the list of Actions you’ll want to select Insert PDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-27-at-7.52.02-PM.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[406]&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-410&quot; src=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-27-at-7.52.02-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;389&quot; height=&quot;104&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you will want to set the parameters for the insert.  There are 4 parameters for an insert:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the name of the new file that will be generated.  No extension is needed, it will automatically be added.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Destination:&lt;/strong&gt; Space where the new file will be stored.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insert at page:&lt;/strong&gt; Where page 1 of the inserted PDF will start in the targeted PDF.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insert:&lt;/strong&gt; The PDF to insert into the targeted PDF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-27-at-7.52.24-PM.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[406]&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-411&quot; src=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-27-at-7.52.24-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;621&quot; height=&quot;319&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, you’ll get a message summarizing the action you are taking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-27-at-7.52.58-PM.png&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[406]&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-412&quot; src=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/11/Screen-shot-2010-11-27-at-7.52.58-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;488&quot; height=&quot;62&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See pretty simple!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this post I want to share another policy from recent request from a customer.  The project was to help them develop a way to have usage quotas set to a default value when a new user/person was added to Alfresco. (There is an important distinction between the two.)  A few months ago I had a discussion about possible ways to implement this kind of functionality with a co-worker and had a few ideas brewing as we started the engagement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First some background on quotas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The default quota in Alfresco is unlimited.  In other words, there is no limit in the amount (total size) of content a user can add/own in Alfresco.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A quota can be set either on creation or at anytime during a users lifetime. 
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From within the UI a quota can be in either GB, MB or KB.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;From an API  (Web Script, JavaScript, Java) it accepts the size in bytes.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Usages_and_Quotas&quot;&gt;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Usages_and_Quotas&lt;/a&gt; for additional details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When developing a behavior I continually reference &lt;a href=&quot;http://ecmarchitect.com/&quot;&gt;Jeff Potts’s&lt;/a&gt; tutorial on &lt;a href=&quot;http://ecmarchitect.com/archives/2007/09/26/770&quot;&gt;implementing behaviors&lt;/a&gt;. His table of available policies is a great quick reference.  Of course the definitive source is the Alfresco source code, but not much has changed since Jeff wrote the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JavaScript Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first attempt to implementing this policy was to use a behavior implemented in JavaScript.  I used Jeff’s JavaScript example as the seed for my code.  In fact there was very little I needed to change (mostly just the business logic). It is a great outline to get you going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using JavaScript wasn’t completely successful.  The code did work up to a point and that point was setting the quota.  There is an undocumented (in the wiki) JS function that can be used to set quotas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the People class (note the comment):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;/**
 * Set the content quota in bytes for a person.
 * Only the admin authority can set this value.
 *
 * @param person    Person to set quota against.
 * @param quota     As a string, in bytes, a value of &quot;-1&quot; means no quota is set
*/
public void setQuota(ScriptNode person, String quota)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the transaction the quota was being set, but once the transaction was committed it was lost. The problem being (again see the comments) that the setQuota must be executed by an admin.  A quota must be set explicitly by an admin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript API lacks the ability to execute a script as one user but then run specific code in that script as another user.  This is done for &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.alfresco.com/en/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;amp;t=28475&amp;amp;start=0&quot;&gt;security reasons&lt;/a&gt; (like being able to keep a user from uploading and then executing a malicious script).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the script did not work as desired it still may be useful for something else.  So I’m including links to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.ottleys.net/alfresco/misc_scripts/js_behavior/behaviour-context.xml&quot;&gt;context file&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.ottleys.net/alfresco/misc_scripts/js_behavior/behaviour.js&quot;&gt;script&lt;/a&gt; as part of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Java Behavior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we need to  set the quota as an admin user, we’ll switch to Java which provides a useful means to run code as one user, and execute specific parts as a different user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we jump to that, let’s talk about some of the specifics of our policy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is not much difference in the structure needed for this behavior and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-maxversion-policy/&quot;&gt;Max Version Policy&lt;/a&gt; I wrote about in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/alfresco/alfresco-max-version-policy&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;.  So I used it as a template for this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, users/people in Alfresco are stored as nodes.  If you start to dig into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com/help/webclient/tasks/tuh-admin-nodebrowser.html&quot;&gt;the node browser&lt;/a&gt; you may be drawn to find your users in the user://alfrecoUserStore store.  This is, as the name suggestions, the Alfresco User Store which is used as the native Alfresco authentication source (&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Authentication_Subsystems#AlfrescoNtlm&quot;&gt;alfrescoNTLM&lt;/a&gt;).  The nodes in this store are of type {http://www.alfresco.org/model/user/1.0}user.  Quotas are a property of {http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0}person and are found in the workspace://SpacesStore under system -&amp;gt; people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfresco has no specific policies for user nodes (like an onCreateUser policy), but since they are just nodes we can leverage the onCreateNode policy. Also because they are just nodes, when using an onCreateNode policy we don’t want the policy to be run every time a node is created.  We want to target cm:person nodes.  Otherwise, we would need to overcomplicate the code with additional tests to only only execute the business logic when the newly created node is of type cm:person.  So we can bind our policy to a specific type.  Similarly to the max version policy we initialize our behavior and bind it in the init method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;public void init() {

this.onCreateNode = new JavaBehaviour(this, &quot;onCreateNode&quot;, NotificationFrequency.TRANSACTION_COMMIT);

this.policyComponent.bindClassBehaviour(QName.createQName(NamespaceService.ALFRESCO_URI, &quot;onCreateNode&quot;), ContentModel.TYPE_PERSON, this.onCreateNode);

}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the init() above we bind our policy: QName.createQName(NamespaceService.ALFRESCO_URI, “onCreateNode”), the type: ContentModel.TYPE_PERSON and the behavior: this.onCreateNode together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we need to implement the onCreateNode method from the OnCreateNodePolicy in our new class&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;public void onCreateNode(ChildAssociationRef childAssocRef) {&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can grab our reference to the newly created user node from the ChildAssociationRef parameter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;final NodeRef user = childAssocRef.getChildRef();&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that it is using the final modifier.  Variables from an outer class that are being referenced in an inner class must be defined as final.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our default policy we also want to allow the default quota to be overwritten.  If an admin wants to set a different value for the quota at creation time we need to allow it. So we need to first get the value that was assigned to the user on the node at creation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;long currentQuota = contentUsageService.getUserQuota((String) nodeService.getProperty(user,ContentModel.PROP_USERNAME));&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The default value of no quota is -1.  If an admin has set a value for the quota it will be greater than 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;if (currentQuota &amp;lt; 0) {

...business logic here...

}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because quotas can only be set by an admin we need to use the runAs utility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;AuthenticationUtil.runAs(

new AuthenticationUtil.RunAsWork&amp;lt;Object&amp;gt;() {

public Object doWork() throws Exception {

...code to be run as a different user...

}

}, &quot;admin&quot;);&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;runAs takes two parameters: The first is the RunAsWork Object, which contains an inner class that has the code that needs to be run as another user.  Second the name of the user to execute the code as.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in our policy we can set the quota.  We’ll use the contentUsageService to set the new users quota, taking the username and the value of the quota as parameters. Also note that default value is in bytes which is read from the spring context file for the OTB default I’ve chosen 2GB (2147483648).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: java; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;contentUsageService.setUserQuota((String) nodeService.getProperty(user, ContentModel.PROP_USERNAME), Long.parseLong(defaultQuota));

return user; &lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RunAsWork is also looking for a return value which I’ve set as user.  We won’t being doing anything with this value so in this case it is an arbitrary return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Installing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy is &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-defaultquota-policy/downloads/detail?name=alfresco-defaultquota-policy.amp&quot;&gt;packaged as an AMP&lt;/a&gt; and is downloadable from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-defaultquota-policy/&quot;&gt;alfresco-defaultquota-policy project&lt;/a&gt; hosted on Google Code.  (See &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Module_Management_Tool&quot;&gt;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Module_Management_Tool&lt;/a&gt; for detailed instructions on installing AMPs.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amp has been tested with Alfresco Enterprise 3.1.1 to 3.3.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only tested this on Enterprise 3.3.2.  I’ll look to expand my testing soon.  If you have a chance to try it on another version of Alfresco please let me know.  (In that case you’ll need to build the amp from source, changing the version.min/max property to include the version you’re targeting.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this policy is limited to setting the user quota, your probably thinking what else can I use this for? I know I am!  Maybe your using a database or some other none supported user store in Alfresco and you want to populate the user node properties with details from that system.  Or you want to add them to specific groups based on some complex business logic.  Or interact with external systems when a user is created in Alfresco.  What are your ideas?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also believe that this should work with any external authentication/synchronization of users into Alfresco.  I’ve not tested it, but it is the list of things to test next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m always looking for feedback: let me know what worked or didn’t for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core of the web scripts was quick to write.  The fun (more time consuming) part was working with exception handling in javascipt.  I know tons of fun right!  There are few different ways to use exception handling based on which version of Alfresco you are using.  The customer is on Enterprise 3.1 and I wanted to make sure that the web scripts also worked on the more current releases of Alfresco as well.  A &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.alfresco.com/jira/browse/ALF-1958&quot;&gt;change (re: addition)&lt;/a&gt; was made in Enterprise 3.2.1 and Community 3.3 to help simplify exception handeling.  I’ll talk about exception handling and these differences in a follow up post.  For now let’s talk about these new web scripts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;permissions-get&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;permissions GET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first web script returns all of the permissions for a specified node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The URL used is &lt;code&gt;/alfresco/service/permissions/{store_type}/{store_id}/{id}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;store_type&lt;/code&gt;: The type of store you want to query, ex: &lt;code&gt;workspace&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;store_id&lt;/code&gt;: The ID of the store you want to query, ex: &lt;code&gt;SpacesStore&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;: The UUID of the node, ex: &lt;code&gt;aed218e8-df44-4865-84cd-0105252f4993&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above values are joined together to form the nodeRef.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the node is not found a 404 error will be returned, any missing URI parameters will result in a 400 error and if you don’t have permission to view the node you will get a 401 error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web script will return a JSON object that looks like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;{ &quot;permissions&quot;: [
&quot;ALLOWED;user1;Coordinator&quot;,
&quot;ALLOWED;user2;Coordinator&quot;
] ,
&quot;inherit&quot;: false }&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return object lists the permissions in a triplet for that node. The permissions triplet follow this format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;[ALLOWED|DENIED];[USERNAME|GROUPNAME];PERMISSION&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also returns a boolean value indicating if some permissions are inherited from the parent node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above example shows two permissions are assigned to the node: the Coordinator permission is given to user1 and user2 on this node. Permissions are not inherited from the parent node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;permissions-post&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;permissions POST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This web script enables you to modify the permissions for a given node&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is called through the same URL as the above web script but as a POST instead of a get: &lt;code&gt;/alfresco/service/permissions/{store_type}/{store_id}/{id}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, if the node is not found a 404 error will be returned, any missing URI parameters will result in a 400 error and if you don’t have permission to modify the node, you will get a 401 error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must also pass a JSON object containing the permissions that are being changed, deleted or added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;{ permissions: [
&quot;REMOVE;user3;All&quot;,
&quot;REMOVE;user2;All&quot;,
&quot;ADD;user4;Coordinator&quot;,
&quot;ADD;GROUP_usergroup1;Consumer&quot;
] ,
&quot;inherit&quot;: false }
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above example uses the following triplet to define a permission&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;[ADD|REMOVE];[USERNAME|GROUPNAME];PERMISSION&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the values are defined as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;ADD | REMOVE&lt;/code&gt;: Do you want to add or remove the permission for this user/group? Any other value passed will result in a 400 error.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;USERNAME | GROUPNAME&lt;/code&gt;: The user or group you want the permission to be added or removed for. Group names must be prefixed by GROUP_. Unknown users or groups will result in a 400 error.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;PERMISSION&lt;/code&gt;: The supported permissions options are defined in&lt;br /&gt; &lt;code&gt;org.alfresco.service.cmr.security.PermissionService&lt;/code&gt; or through custom extension to the permission model. Unknown permissions will result in a 400 error.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The object can also contain an optional inherit permission value to specifying if the permissions for this node should be inherited from the parent node. Without the inherit option, the current value for the node is maintained. Inherited permissions can not be removed from a node.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The return format is the same as the return format of the permissions GET web script above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This web script is also transactional: any errors will result in the node being returned to the state before the call was made. (The exception handling in the controller was added for these conditions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These scripts can be installed as an AMP.  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-permissions-webscripts/source/checkout&quot;&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-permissions-webscripts/downloads/list&quot;&gt;AMPs&lt;/a&gt; are hosted in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-permissions-webscripts/&quot;&gt;alfresco-permissions-webscripts&lt;/a&gt; project on Google Code.  The code is available for either &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-permissions-webscripts/downloads/detail?name=alfresco-permissions-webscripts-pre.3.2.1.amp&quot;&gt;pre-3.2.1 (starting with 3.1)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-permissions-webscripts/downloads/detail?name=alfresco-permissions-webscripts.amp&quot;&gt;3.2.1 to 3.3.1&lt;/a&gt;.  These are all Enterprise releases numbers.  The web scripts have been tested against these releases.  There may not be any need to modify the web scripts for Community releases (except for the min and max version numbers in the module.properties file).  Pre community 3.3 should use the pre 3.2.1 release.  No community releases have been tested. (If you try these on a community releases, please comment either here or in the Google Code Project.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a follow up post, I’ll cover exception handling with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve written before about &lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/alfresco/tunneling-debug-and-jmx-for-alfresco&quot;&gt;configuring Alfresco to use tunneling to connect JMX &amp;amp; debuggers&lt;/a&gt; to servers that don’t allow access to the higher numbered ports (or to only a few ports).  Let’s add another cool tool. (JMX is an Enterprise only feature of Alfresco.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com&quot;&gt;Alfresco wiki&lt;/a&gt; covers a few of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/JMX#Connecting_through_JMX_Consoles_.2F_JSR-160&quot;&gt;clients&lt;/a&gt; that are available out there.  Let’s add another type to the list:  JMX from the command line.  There are a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=jmx+command+line&quot;&gt;couple of options&lt;/a&gt; for us to choose from.   I am partial to j&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyclopsgroup.org/projects/jmxterm/index.html&quot;&gt;mxterm&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cyclopsgroup.org/&quot;&gt;CyclopsGroups.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jmxterm is an opensource  JMX Client (&lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/cyclops-group/files/jmxterm/&quot;&gt;download&lt;/a&gt;).  It supports auto completion, history browsing and scripting.  In a word: cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s jump in…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing you need to do with the client is connect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With jmxterm you can pass a connection string via the jar to connect to Alfresco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;java -jar jmxterm-1.0-alpha-4-uber.jar -l \ service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://&amp;lt;host&amp;gt;:50500/alfresco/jmxrmi -p &amp;lt;password&amp;gt; -u &amp;lt;user&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, you can connect via the interactive shell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;java -jar jmxterm-1.0-alpha-4-uber.jar&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, using the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; command connect to Alfresco&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$&amp;gt;open service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:50500/alfresco/jmxrmi -p change_asap -u \ controlRole&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#Connection to service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:50500/alfresco/jmxrmi is opened&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, using the &lt;code&gt;jvms&lt;/code&gt; command (with the appropriate user permissions you can list the running java processes on the machine jmxterm is running on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$&amp;gt;jvms&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
94822    ( ) - jmxterm-1.0-alpha-4-uber.jar&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
13157    (m) - org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap start&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And once again use the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; command to connect&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$&amp;gt;open 13157 -u controlRole -p change_asap&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#Connection to 13157 is opened&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you are connected  let’s perform a simple operation, finding out who is logged into Alfresco and then disconnect one of the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First you’ll list the domains that are available&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$&amp;gt;domains&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#following domains are available&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Alfresco&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Catalina&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
JMImplementation&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Users&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
axis&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
com.sun.management&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
connector&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
java.lang&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
java.util.logging&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
log4j&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bean you need is in the &lt;code&gt;Alfresco&lt;/code&gt; domain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$&amp;gt;domain Alfresco&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#domain is set to Alfresco&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can look up the beans within the domain by using the &lt;code&gt;beans&lt;/code&gt; command.  There are quite a few beans in the &lt;code&gt;Alfresco&lt;/code&gt; domain, so let’s connect directly to the one that you need: &lt;code&gt;RepoServerMgmt&lt;/code&gt;. (Don’t forget jmxterm support auto completion.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$&amp;gt;bean Alfresco:Name=RepoServerMgmt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#bean is set to Alfresco:Name=RepoServerMgmt&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have the bean, you can now find out what it does by using the &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; command&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$&amp;gt;info&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#mbean = Alfresco:Name=RepoServerMgmt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#class name = org.alfresco.repo.admin.RepoServerMgmt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
# attributes&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
%0   - LinkValidationDisabled (boolean, r)&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
%1   - MaxUsers (int, r)&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
%2   - ReadOnly (boolean, r)&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
%3   - TicketCountAll (int, r)&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
%4   - TicketCountNonExpired (int, r)&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
%5   - UserCountAll (int, r)&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
%6   - UserCountNonExpired (int, r)&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
# operations&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
%0   - int invalidateTicketsAll()&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
%1   - int invalidateTicketsExpired()&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
%2   - void invalidateUser(java.lang.String p1)&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
%3   - [Ljava.lang.String; listUserNamesAll()&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
%4   - [Ljava.lang.String; listUserNamesNonExpired()&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#there&apos;s no notifications&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of things you can do here, you can get attributes, you can set attributes, you can run opertaions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the returned attributes you can tell a few things: the datatype of each attribute and if you can change it.  In this case none of our attributes can be modified, they are all read only (r).  ReadWrite would be signified by rw.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Operations are just like Java functions: they can have a return type and you might be able pass parameters to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can also list notifcations, but there is no mechanism (that I have found yet) in jmxterm to subscribe or unsubscribe to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s do some more work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let’s see how many users are logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$&amp;gt;get UserCountNonExpired&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#mbean = Alfresco:Name=RepoServerMgmt:&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
UserCountNonExpired = 2;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now let’s find out who these two users are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$&amp;gt;run listUserNamesNonExpired&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#calling operation listUserNamesNonExpired of mbean Alfresco:Name=RepoServerMgmt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#operation returns:&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
[ System, admin ]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So you have 2 user currently in Alfresco: System and admin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s log out the admin user.  (Look back at the list from the &lt;code&gt;info&lt;/code&gt; command.) You can either invalidate all of the authenticated users tickets or we can invalidate named user.  Since you just want to remove one user let’s invalidate the admin users session.  (The System user is a special account, so you will ignore it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$&amp;gt;run invalidateUser admin&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#calling operation invalidateUser of mbean Alfresco:Name=RepoServerMgmt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#operation returns:&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
null&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that this operation does not return anything so jmxterm returns &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s now check and see if the admin user is still logged in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$&amp;gt;run listUserNamesNonExpired&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#calling operation listUserNamesNonExpired of mbean Alfresco:Name=RepoServerMgmt&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
#operation returns:&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
[ System ]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve now run through some basic operations: connecting to Alfresco, listing and selecting the domain, listing and selecting the bean, discovering what the bean can do, getting an attribute, running an operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last things to cover are scripting/non-interactive mode and setting properties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From time to time you might see the need, to lock Alfresco down by setting it to Read Only mode. The following two commands will help us do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let’s check the current state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$ echo get -s -b Alfresco:Name=RepoServerMgmt ReadOnly | java -jar jmxterm-1.0-alpha-4-uber.jar -l service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:50500/alfresco/jmxrmi -p change_asap -u controlRole -v silent -n&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When passing commands to jmxterm, you need to echo the command into the interpreter. So the above command passes the jmxterm get command.  we pass it a &lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt; since we just want the value and not the full expression (&lt;code&gt;ReadOnly = &amp;lt;value&amp;gt;;&lt;/code&gt;) returned &lt;code&gt;-b&lt;/code&gt; names the bean and finally the attribute we are querying. On the jmxterm side we pass the connection information (connection string or PID, username and password), set the verbosity of the execution, and tell it that it should run in non-interactive mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case the command returns the value &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. So the value of &lt;code&gt;ReadOnly&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; — Alfresco is in Read/Write mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s put it in ReadOnly mode&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;$ echo set -b Alfresco:Category=sysAdmin,Type=Configuration,id1=default server.transaction.allow-writes false | java -jar jmxterm-1.0-alpha-4-uber.jar -l service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:50500/alfresco/jmxrmi -p change_asap -u controlRole -v silent -n&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This follow pretty much the same pattern.  The &lt;code&gt;ReadOnly&lt;/code&gt; attribute is a read only property, so to change Alfresco into Read Only mode you set the value of &lt;code&gt;server.transaction.allow-writes&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. The set will not return any value.  You can then check the current state of the repository by running the previous command and then when you are ready to put the repository back in Read/Write mode change the value of the set command on &lt;code&gt;server.transaction.allow-writes&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of a POC for a customer I was asked to write an extension that allowed them to control the total number of versions allowed per versioned content. (Download links at bottom of page)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfresco has a strong versioning story, that gives you the ability to version any content stored in the repository, no matter what the file type.  Versions are full files and not diffs of the files.  Alfresco gives you the ability to have both major and minor versions of content.  Versions can be created/updated by checkout/checkin, by rule, through any interface or through script/APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfresco also provides the ability to apply behaviors / policies to content/metadata within the repository.  You can think of these as event listeners, that allow you to take custom actions based on what is happening within the repository.  [Jeff Potts][1] has written an excellent [tutorial on creating behaviors][2], with examples for both Java and javascript. (Other resources include: )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 4 versioning policies that we can work with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;beforeCreateVersion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;afterCreateVersion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;onCreateVersion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;calculateVersionLabel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(For an [example of a calculateVersionLabel policy][3] look at this post and the accompanying code by [Peter][4] [Monks][5].)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this policy we are going to use afterCreateVersion:  after a version is created we want to remove any version that puts us past the max version value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start by implementing the [policy interface][6] for the policy you want to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;public class MaxVersionPolicy implements AfterCreateVersionPolicy&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding the method implemented by the interface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;pre style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&amp;gt;public void afterCreateVersion(
				NodeRef versionableNode,
				Version version)&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`

We also need to [bind][7] the [behavior][8] to the policy and we need to do this when the class is loaded by the springframework.  We wrap this registration in an init() method

` `

` `

`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;	public void init() {
		this.afterCreateVersion = new JavaBehaviour(this, &quot;afterCreateVersion&quot;,
				NotificationFrequency.TRANSACTION_COMMIT);

		this.policyComponent.bindClassBehaviour(QName.createQName(
				NamespaceService.ALFRESCO_URI, &quot;afterCreateVersion&quot;),
				MaxVersionPolicy.class, this.afterCreateVersion);
	}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`

The init method is then called when spring loads the bean

` `

` `

`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;		&lt;bean id=&quot;maxVersion&quot; class=&quot;org.alfresco.extension.versioning.MaxVersionPolicy&quot; init-method=&quot;init&quot;&gt;
			&lt;property name=&quot;policyComponent&quot;&gt;
				&lt;ref bean=&quot;policyComponent&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;/property&gt;
			&lt;property name=&quot;versionService&quot;&gt;
				&lt;ref bean=&quot;versionService&quot; /&gt;
			&lt;/property&gt;
			&lt;!-- The max number of versions per versioned node --&gt;
			&lt;property name=&quot;maxVersions&quot;&gt;
				&lt;value&gt;10&lt;/value&gt;
			&lt;/property&gt;
		&lt;/bean&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`

Now to the meat of the policy, enforcing the removal of versions.

First we we have our maxVersion property.  This is set in the springbean (see above) and read when the bean is loaded. (You can overwrite the default value by copying the maxversionpolicy-context.xml file into the extensions directory and changing the value of the maxVersion property)

` `

` `

`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;	public void setMaxVersions(int maxVersions) {
		this.maxVersions = maxVersions;
	}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`

Next we want to remove any version that puts us over the max

` `

` `

`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; 	@Override
	public void afterCreateVersion(NodeRef nodeRef, Version version) {

		VersionHistory versionHistory = versionService
				.getVersionHistory(nodeRef);

		// If the current number of versions in the VersionHistory is greater
		// than the maxVersions limit, remove the root/least recent version
		if (versionHistory.getAllVersions().size() &amp;gt; maxVersions) {
			logger.debug(&quot;Removing Version: &quot;
					+ versionHistory.getRootVersion().getVersionLabel());
			versionService.deleteVersion(nodeRef, versionHistory
					.getRootVersion());
		}
	}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`

We first get the [versionHistory][9] for the node and check it against the maxVersion property. If we have more versions than the limit we delete the [least recent][10] [version][11] from the version history.

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_363&quot; style=&quot;width: 803px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-363&quot; src=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/07/Screen-shot-2010-07-23-at-12.45.06-AM1.png&quot; alt=&quot;10 Version Limt&quot; width=&quot;793&quot; height=&quot;292&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Notice: 10 total versions; least recent version is 1.1; no pagination!
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&amp;gt; **Q:** Why are you using an if statement, instead of looping through all of the versions.  I have a few (many) more versions over the limit I want to impose?
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; **A:** A while statement would be more efficient in removing everything above the limit, but the versionHistory object isn&amp;#8217;t being updated with each delete in a loop (I tried) until the policy has completely run.  Luckily, as you will find as you implement custom behaviors, they get called a lot!  So while a single update will result in a single version added, you will actually see that the behavior is called multiple times for that one action (In testing I saw the behavior being called a minimum of 7 times).  While you might not clear out every version over the limit with a single update, you will see a good many of them removed.  If you want to bring every down to the limit you could create a &amp;#8220;cleaner&amp;#8221; extension that could go in and remove all of the versions over the limit (this would be a very intensive/costly operation depending on the amount of content in your repository and the size of your version history  &amp;#8211;  There several different strategies for this).  You could then use this extension to enforce that limit.

&amp;gt; **Q:** Does this affect all versioned content in the repository?  What if I only want it to work on some content?
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; **A:** Yes, by default this policy is being applied to all versioned content, but you could add in checks to look for a specific aspect, parent space name, property, etc. before passing through the delete code.

&amp;gt; **Q:** Compliance regulations/laws don&amp;#8217;t allow me to delete the versions, but require me keep them for X years. How can I archive versions?
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; **A:** There are probably several different ways to handle this.  One way could be to use Alfresco&amp;#8217;s [content store selector][12].  The content store selector allows you to configure multiple underlying filesystem locations for your content.  To the end user all of the content appears to come from the same location, while the content itself lives in different disc systems. The idea would be to set up a secondary store that would act as the archive.  When your trigger is reached, be it a property (status [property or aspect], date, etc.), a version number/count, etc. have the policy move the content to the archive space structure (The archive will need to have the cm:storeSelector aspect set to mark it to use the secondary store). Because we are working from the least recent version, the 1.0 version of the content, it becomes the first version in the archive, each subsequent version, is added as a version for the content, version numbers are then maintained in the archive. I would also add an aspect to the original node that contains a pointer/aspect to the archived version, for reference. Then delete the least recent version of the original versioned node.

0/ For JMX: From Alfresco 3.2 sp1 (enterprise release) on you no longer need to add the custom-core-services-context.xml file.  Instead in the alfresco-global.properties file add monitor.r</summary><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Back in February I wrote a post on &lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/alfresco/tunneling-debug-and-jmx-for-alfresco&quot;&gt;Tunneling Debug and JMX with Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;.  Here are a few updates to that post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0/ For JMX: From Alfresco 3.2 sp1 (enterprise release) on you no longer need to add the custom-core-services-context.xml file.  Instead in the alfresco-global.properties file add monitor.rmi.services.port=50508 to set the static port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1/ How can I get this work on Windows?  I’ve tested with two options: &lt;a href=&quot;http://cygwin.com/&quot;&gt;Cygwin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/&quot;&gt;Putty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  Cygwin: this is option is the most straight forward.  Install Cygwin.  On the Select Packages screen do a search for openssh and select it for install.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  The same ssh commands will work for creating tunnels under a Cygwin shell that you can use with Linux or Max OS X.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  Putty: The only way I&amp;#8217;ve been successful with connecting JMX with putty was by using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.60/htmldoc/Chapter7.html#plink&quot;&gt;plink&lt;/a&gt; command line executable.  The graphical interface doesn&amp;#8217;t allow you set the first hostname that is needed for the second tunnel.  plink gets this done.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  Let&amp;#8217;s take a look at some real examples&amp;#8230;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  For debug:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 0px;margin-bottom: 15px;margin-left: 0px;line-height: 18px;padding-top: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  On the server:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 0px;margin-bottom: 15px;margin-left: 0px;line-height: 18px;padding-top: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  Add the following to your &lt;code style=&quot;padding: 0px;margin: 0px&quot;&gt;alfresco.sh&lt;/code&gt; file:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 0px;margin-bottom: 15px;margin-left: 0px;line-height: 18px;padding-top: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code style=&quot;padding: 0px;margin: 0px&quot;&gt;export JAVA_OPTS=&quot;${JAVA_OPTS} -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8082&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 0px;margin-bottom: 15px;margin-left: 0px;line-height: 18px;padding-top: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  The &lt;code style=&quot;padding: 0px;margin: 0px&quot;&gt;address&lt;/code&gt; parameter sets the port you want the debugger to listen on.  Adding this line, will require you to restart Alfresco/tomcat for it to become active.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 0px;margin-bottom: 15px;margin-left: 0px;line-height: 18px;padding-top: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  On the client:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 0px;margin-bottom: 15px;margin-left: 0px;line-height: 18px;padding-top: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  Using standard port forwarding with ssh will enable Java debugging using plink
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code style=&quot;margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 0px;margin-bottom: 15px;margin-left: 0px;line-height: 18px;padding-top: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;plink &amp;lt;user&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;ip/host/dns address&amp;gt; -L 2000:localhost:8082 -N&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 0px;margin-bottom: 15px;margin-left: 0px;line-height: 18px;padding-top: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  The debugger is then set to connect to &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; using port &lt;code&gt;2000&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;margin-top: 0px;margin-right: 0px;margin-bottom: 15px;margin-left: 0px;line-height: 18px;padding-top: 0px;padding-right: 0px;padding-bottom: 0px;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  For JMX:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  On the server:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  Modify &lt;code&gt;alfresco.sh&lt;/code&gt;:  set &lt;code&gt;-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote&lt;/code&gt; equal to &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;.  Append &lt;code&gt;-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=dummyhost&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;JAVA_OPTS&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  Add &lt;code&gt;monitor.rmi.services.port=50508&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;alfresco-global.properties&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  On the client:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  Add &lt;code&gt;127.0.0.1 dummyhost&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  Using plink from the command line, run the following two commands:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;plink &amp;lt;user&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;ip/dns of server&amp;gt; -L 2001:localhost:50500 -N&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;plink &amp;lt;user&amp;gt;@&amp;lt;ip/dns of server&amp;gt; -L dummyhost:50508:localhost:50508 -N&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  Now you can connect to Alfresco using a jmx console, like jconsole (ships with jre/jdk).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  the connection string will look like this:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:2001/alfresco/jmxrmi&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  Unless you&amp;#8217;ve changed them, the default username and password are &lt;code&gt;controlRole&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;change_asap&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I worked Pre-Sales here at [Alfresco][1] I had, on occasion, the chance to talk about integrating Alfresco with a [GIS (G][2][eographic Information System)][2]. I don’t have a lot of experience with these types of systems (actually none) but I always believed that integration was possible. (It falls into one of those categories where we believe that it is possible, but we have never actually seen it done.) Or even that a simple type of integration could be done with [Google Maps][3] to provide basic information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started playing with the Google Maps APIs almost 6 months ago and was able to throw together a rough POC, but felt that there was still more that I could do.  I’ve gotten closer to what I envisioned and a have put together a starting example, but there is still a lot of work to do, including working around issues from the underlying APIs. (ie one of my examples will not work in some versions of Firefox or IE…I’m working on these, but believe that the answer may actually be in the code of either the browser or the Maps API.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should note that my example is based off of US addresses.  If you are outside of the US you may need to customize these further to meet your needs, but the underlying code should work fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content Map&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first attempt, used an aspect to contain the address. The fields I looked at are: address, city, state and zip code. Any of these, or any combination of these, can be passed to Google to get the coordinates. In this release, I’ve stuck with this design with a little modification.  The map that is rendered for the document (as a presentation template in the document details page) uses a static google map.  This is quick and easy, it is basically an image tag that has several parameter passed as part of the src.  This approach works find for our simple content item map, but has some limitations, for example you can’t design it provide more in-depth information like the little pop up information windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both of these example maps (the document based map and the space map that we will discuss next) it requires some additional changes to the core Alfresco App.  I needed to do two things: make a call within my web script to an external resource, in this case Google Maps, to take an address turn it into map coordinates.  And have the presentation template call the web script.  With a little help from Yong Qu, I was able to address both of these.  For the first issue you can enable the ‘remote’ object in javaScript.  This is enabled by default for Alfresco Share, but not in Alfresco Explorer.  Yong has an easy to follow, [example on his blog][4], on how to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the remote object then, we make a simple set of calls like below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;uri = &quot;http://maps.google.com/maps/geo?q=&quot;+encodeURI(fullAddress)+&quot;&amp;amp;key=&quot;+key+&quot;&amp;amp;sensor=false&amp;amp;output=json&quot;

var connector = remote.connect(&quot;http&quot;);
var result = connector.call(uri);

var obj = eval(&quot;(&quot;+result+&quot;)&quot;);

coordinates = obj.Placemark[0].Point.coordinates[1]+&quot;,&quot;+obj.Placemark[0].Point.coordinates[0];&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should also note that the json that is returned to our call is returned as a string.  We will need to turn it into an javascript object to work with it by using the javaScript eval function.  Once we have done this, we can working on the json as a standard object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This object, remote, however us not enabled for use in presentation templates. So again, borrowing from Yong, I used YUI (which we ship and use in Alfresco) to allow me to make the call out to get the map, via web script.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our YUI code, again is pretty straight forward…make the call to the web script, set the returned code to be the html of a specified div tag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;script src=&quot;/alfresco/yui/yahoo.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&quot;/alfresco/yui/event.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&quot;/alfresco/yui/connection.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&amp;gt;

 var handleSuccess = function(o){
    var div = document.getElementById(&apos;mapping&apos;);
    div.innerHTML = o.responseText; }

var handleFailure = function(o){
    var div = document.getElementById(&apos;mapping&apos;);
    div.innerHTML = &quot;Map not available&quot;; }

var callback = {
 	  success: handleSuccess,
 	  failure: handleFailure,
 	  argument: {} }

var request = YAHOO.util.Connect.asyncRequest(&apos;GET&apos;, &apos;/alfresco/wcservice/map/workspace/SpacesStore/${document.id}&apos;, callback);
&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to incude the js references as the beginning. This enables us to make successful calls to this script without the wrapper of our presentation template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, notice the url that we are calling, 1/ the call is relative to the application we are running. 2/We are using wcservice. This make it so that we are not prompted to login each time the web script is called.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-339 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-05-31-at-11.07.21-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-05-31 at 11.07.21 PM&quot; width=&quot;659&quot; height=&quot;266&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned above, this is the easer part especially since the hard parts were already thought out by Yong….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space Map&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second map, I initially wanted it to be a presentation template, with an amalgamation of spaces &amp;amp; content, on a single map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The static maps API is a not a fit here.  I wanted to have a map that allowed me not to just specify the location for each child in a space, but also display a limited set of specific information about that piece of content. ** Note:** This does mean that you may need to develop a specific “folder” based taxonomy to better organize content by location.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said above, my original attempts here were to try and do everything in a presentation template.  It would make multiple calls through YUI to get coordinates for the children of the space.  But YUI here becomes the bottleneck, especially since, I could not find a way to pass information out of the YUI Connection Managers callbacks.  This greatly limits the design…and ends up nesting calls to a depth of &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; as we loop through all of the children in a space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to overcome this would be to include in the model/aspect the coordinates. This would reduce the YUI calls to zero.  One problem with this approach would be the changes to address need to result in updates to those coordinates.  This can be achieved through a behavior, watching the onUpdateProperties method for changes on those nodes. So for this first attempt, I’ve decided to skip this.  I’ll revisit this in an upcoming revision to the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started my new web script by moving the logic that I worked on from the presentation template to this web script.  This was pretty straight forward.  We reused the remote object we enabled from before to pass our location (address string) back to Google.  I ignore 99% of what is returned in the json because what we are really after is the coordinates that we can pass to the Google Maps javaScript API.  I choose the javaScript API this time, because it allows me to create infoWindows where I can present the user with some basic metadata about the content along with links to either download or browse to the content.  I’m not much a UI designer so my poor attempts at layout are sure to make some squirm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that was useful in this approach was to pass javaScript Associative Arrays to Freemarker.  This allowed me to specify the properties that I wanted/needed directly from witha larger sequence of objects without needing use multiple loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was pretty straight forward:  I created an array in my controller.  At each element in the array, I created a new Array where I stored my values referenced by a key.  I could then in the FTL, start my list, and then reference each child by key name instead of looping again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;var big = new Array();

//some code that ends of looping over something
//take our properties/metadata stick them in an array

var _child = new Array();

_child[&quot;nodeID&quot;] = child.id;
_child[&quot;location&quot;] = _location;
_child[&quot;latitude&quot;] = _latlong[&quot;latitude&quot;];
_child[&quot;longitude&quot;] = _latlong[&quot;longitude&quot;];

.push(_child);
//end loop

model.big = big&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in the ftl:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;#list big as b&amp;gt;

var _latlng${child_index} = new google.maps.LatLng(${child[&quot;latitude&quot;]},${child[&quot;longitude&quot;]});

&amp;lt;/#list&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we query for the specific node we want to work with where the value we want to pass to the query is in the Associative Array, we need to first clean the variable up, then it will work without throwing an error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;#assign ref = child[&quot;nodeID&quot;]&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;#list companyhome.childrenByLuceneSearch[&quot;ID:workspace\\:\\/\\/SpacesStore\\/${ref}&quot;] as _child&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-340 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/06/Screen-shot-2010-06-01-at-1.26.00-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen shot 2010-06-01 at 1.26.00 AM&quot; width=&quot;750&quot; height=&quot;255&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my design I planned to reuse to the same pattern of using YUI within the presentation template to make the call to the web script, however when attempting to write the generated javaScript to the div tag where the map was to be displayed, I was reminded that the javaScript was never executed. It was treated as a string.  It is possible to get around this by using the javaScript eval function to execute the script, but this means turning the content retuned into a big string with lots of escapes…This would kill one of my design choices of making it possible to make direct calls to the web script and have it return a map that could be embedded in different things or be used stand alone. It could also be a big performance hit depending on how often the looip was made. Now, I could go back and write into the content branches to turn areas of the web script ftl on and off as a big sting, but this would over complicate the ftl.  This lead to the simplest fallback: have the presentation template reference the web script as part of an iFrame.  This worked nicely, but it helped to highlight what I thought was an issue with using the eval function:  there is a bug in the newest release of the maps API:  it was also happening in the iFrame on IE and Firefox.  For the moment I’ll let the script stand, it does work in Safari and Chrome, but it leaves out the major browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;How to use&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    We are still a bit early for heavy use of our plug.  We need to work out a few caching issues, the display issues are IE and Firefox, and modification of core Alfresco configs.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    For this initial release I won&amp;#8217;t provide an amp.  I&amp;#8217;m want people to know that they will need to dig into this to learn it and extended it.  I&amp;#8217;d also like to transfer this to be used in Share.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-simplegis/source/checkout&quot;&gt;The source code&lt;/a&gt; is available at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-simplegis/&quot;&gt;Google Code Project &amp;#8212; alfresco-simplegis&lt;/a&gt;.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    If you want to call the web scripts directly:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    For the document map use: /map/{store_type}/{store_id}/{id}
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    For the Space map use: /map/coordinates/{store_type}/{store_id}/{id}
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Both of these will require that the space/content have the mappable aspect applied along with at least the zipcode applied.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Spaces can control the default zoom level for their maps.  By default that value is 8.  You should adjust it based on your need.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Document maps are static: there is no zoom or pan.  Space maps support both zoom and pan.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;What next?&lt;/strong&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    This project is still early in its development.  If you have ideas on how to overcome the Firefox or IE issues, your help would be appreciated.  I&amp;#8217;m also going to be tackling the &amp;#8220;caching&amp;#8221; issue shortly.  This seems to me to be a useful feature.  Along with a good understanding of how you can script behaviors for properties when they are updated.

&lt;p&gt;The script was written to give them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A list of content that had been modified from a point in time until “now” (The time of execution).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Specify a specific space or recurse the child spaces for the named space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;return a specified XML structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparing for this post I’ve added some modifications/fixes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve added two new return formats: JSON and HTML&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;fixed an issue that allows it to run on the 3.2.x release of Alfresco.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some insights to a few areas of the script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucene Date Queries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two specific things to remember about Date queries:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;1 &amp;#8211; Date Format.&lt;/strong&gt; Date queries with Lucene are  looking for the date in an I&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601&quot;&gt;SO8601&lt;/a&gt; format using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Combined_date_and_time_representations&quot;&gt;combined date and time &lt;/a&gt;in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC&quot;&gt;UTC&lt;/a&gt;.  (Even if you are looking just for the date it will complain if you don&amp;#8217;t pass the time ).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  To do this I had originally used  the JavaScript Date prototype from &lt;a href=&quot;http://delete.me.uk/2005/03/iso8601.html&quot;&gt;http://delete.me.uk/2005/03/iso8601.html&lt;/a&gt;. This works fine in pre 3.2 releases.  But due to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://issues.alfresco.com/jira/browse/ETHREEOH-2760&quot;&gt;change in the 3.2 code line&lt;/a&gt; top level objects are now sealed which means you can&amp;#8217;t make these type of prototype change to Root level objects in the JavaScript libraries. So I&amp;#8217;ve made simple modification to Date prototype code allowing me to pass a Date Object into the code which then does the coversion and returns a properly formated ISO8601 string.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;function toISO8601String(date) { // based on http://delete.me.uk/2005/03/iso8601.html
	/*
	 * accepted values for the format [1-6]: 1 Year: YYYY (eg 1997) 2 Year and
	 * month: YYYY-MM (eg 1997-07) 3 Complete date: YYYY-MM-DD (eg 1997-07-16) 4
	 * Complete date plus hours and minutes: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD (eg
	 * 1997-07-16T19:20+01:00) 5 Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds:
	 * YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00) 6 Complete date
	 * plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction of a second
	 * YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00)
	 */
	if (!format) {
		var format = 6;
	}
	if (!offset) {
		var offset = &apos;Z&apos;;
		var date = date;
	} else {
		var d = offset.match(/([-+])([0-9]{2}):([0-9]{2})/);
		var offsetnum = (Number(d[2]) * 60) + Number(d[3]);
		offsetnum *= ((d[1] == &apos;-&apos;) ? -1 : 1);
		var date = new Date(Number(Number(date) + (offsetnum * 60000)));
	}

	var zeropad = function(num) {
		return ((num &amp;lt; 10) ? &apos;0&apos; : &apos;&apos;) + num; 	}

 	var str = &quot;&quot;;
 	str += date.getUTCFullYear(); 	if (format &amp;gt; 1) {
		str += &quot;-&quot; + zeropad(date.getUTCMonth() + 1);
	}
	if (format &amp;gt; 2) {
		str += &quot;-&quot; + zeropad(date.getUTCDate());
	}
	if (format &amp;gt; 3) {
		str += &quot;T&quot; + zeropad(date.getUTCHours()) + &quot;:&quot;
				+ zeropad(date.getUTCMinutes());
	}
	if (format &amp;gt; 5) {
		var secs = Number(date.getUTCSeconds() + &quot;.&quot;
				+ ((date.getUTCMilliseconds() &amp;lt; 100) ? &apos;0&apos; : &apos;&apos;)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;+ zeropad(date.getUTCMilliseconds()));&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;str += &quot;:&quot; + zeropad(secs);&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;} else if (format &amp;gt; 4) {
		str += &quot;:&quot; + zeropad(date.getUTCSeconds());
	}

	if (format &amp;gt; 3) {
		str += offset;
	}
	return str;
}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  I&amp;#8217;ve turned the original prototyping into a function, where I pass a Date object, with the date I want to work with, into this function. I also replaced any reference to &amp;#8216;this&amp;#8217; with that data parameter.  I will admit there is some excess code here that may never be called. But this was the quickest change to accomplish what I needed.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;2 &amp;#8211; Only dates are indexed.&lt;/strong&gt; By default, only the date portion of the property is indexed.  In general, most use cases only require the date .  But in this case, the customer was interested in what may have changed over the period of an hour.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  There are two options for this: Code around or modify how Alfresco indexes these DateTime properties. In this case I choose to code around it.  This means that I am not modifying default behavior in Alfresco&amp;#8230;always a plus.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Code Around.&lt;/strong&gt; We have all the pieces we need to do this: We know the datetime we use for the start and end our range query.  We also have access to the full datetime property (even if it wasn&amp;#8217;t indexed).
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  I chose to pull this into a function that takes the collection (array) of documents found in our range query and then test to see if the datetime property of the node (in this case the modified datetime property) is between our the beginning and end of our range, if so then add it to our new filtered results array.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;function filterResults(unfilteredResults) {
	var now = new Date();
	var filteredResults = new Array();

	for each (node in unfilteredResults) {

		var testDate = new Date(node.properties.modified);

		//if the nodes modified date is between the passed date/time and now add
		//to filteredResult Array
		if ((filterDate &amp;lt;= testDate) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; (testDate &amp;lt;= now)){
			filteredResults.push(node);
		}
	}

	return filteredResults;
}&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  This is clean and simple.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Modify Alfresco.&lt;/strong&gt; While this sounds heavy, it actually isn&amp;#8217;t.  Our support team pointed me at &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.alfresco.com/en/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;amp;t=9122&quot;&gt;this forum post&lt;/a&gt; in which &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/andy_hind/&quot;&gt;Andy Hind&lt;/a&gt; from our engineering team shows us how to change the default behaviour:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  In dataTypeAnalyzers.properties (located inside the war file in WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/model) change:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  d_dictionary.datatype.d_datetime.analyzer=org.alfresco.repo.search.impl.lucene.analysis.DateAnalyser
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  to
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  d_dictionary.datatype.d_datetime.analyzer=org.alfresco.repo.search.impl.lucene.analysis.DateTimeAnalyser
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  Now rebuild your indexes.  Depending on the amount of content in your repository it this may take some time.  It may also not be possible to make this immediate because the  SLA you have with your customers won&amp;#8217;t permit it until you have scheduled maintenance downtime. (HA Clustering is helpful in these situations.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System Folders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that may show up in these queries are system folders.  These folders contain any of the rules that may be associated with a space.  In most queries these folders and their content has no value, so we want to exclude them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This string can be appended to your query string to exclude them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;var systemFolder = &quot;-TYPE:\&quot;cm:systemfolder\&quot; &quot; +
		&quot;-TYPE:\&quot;{http://www.alfresco.org/model/rule/1.0}rule\&quot; &quot; +
		&quot;-TYPE:\&quot;{http://www.alfresco.org/model/action/1.0}compositeaction\&quot; &quot; +
		&quot;-TYPE:\&quot;{http://www.alfresco.org/model/action/1.0}actioncondition\&quot; &quot; +
		&quot;-TYPE:\&quot;{http://www.alfresco.org/model/action/1.0}action\&quot; &quot; +
		&quot;-TYPE:\&quot;{http://www.alfresco.org/model/action/1.0}actionparameter\&quot;&quot;;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PARENT vs PATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we are performing queries for content within a space we have a couple of options.  Two of the most common are PARENT and PATH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARENT queries work directly on a space. No recursion. It will return all of the nodes (spaces and content) in that space.  In other words, PARENT queries work directly on a space without recursion. It will return all of the nodes (spaces and content) in that space alone, but will not return any nodes (spaces and content) that are in sub-spaces of that space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PATH queries are a subset of XPATH.  They are eagerly evaluated.  Thus they can be memory (Caching) and CPU intensive. They are useful if you want more than what is just in the space you are working, may not know the location of the space, or if a space of that name may exist in multiple locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be smart in your choice.  Use PARENT as often as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note For Java extensions:&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal&quot;&gt; u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal&quot;&gt;nless the other clauses in your query are complex, it’s likely more efficient to enumerate (list / ls / dir) a space using the FileFolderService rather than a Lucene query. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;ie. a simple query of the form “PARENT:[noderef]” would be better implemented using FileFolderService.list()&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal&quot;&gt;OK, enough about some of our design decisions let’s talk about how to use the web script.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Install&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: normal&quot;&gt;The web script is packaged in an amp file.  It will work on Alfresco 3.1.1 and newer versions. (I tested up to Alfresco 3.2r) The &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-modified-content-list/downloads/detail?name=alfresco-updatedcontent-webscript.amp&quot;&gt;alfresco-modified-content-list amp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-modified-content-list/source/checkout&quot;&gt;the source&lt;/a&gt; can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-modified-content-list/&quot;&gt;google code project site&lt;/a&gt;. Use the apply_amps script appropriate for your OS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to use it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web script can be called using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/updated/in/{path}/since?date=01/01/2010 13:10:10
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/updated/{path}/since?date=01/01/2010 13:10:10
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a slight difference in the two URLs: ‘in’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘in’ allows you to tell the web script to just list the content in the space passed in the path parameter. Without the ‘in’ the web script will recurse the space structure from the passed path parameter down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, the DateTime structure is not fixed:  Possible (tested) formats are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  mm/dd/yyyy
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  yyyy/mm/dd
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  mm/dd/yyyy hh:mm:ss
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hh is expecting a 24 hour clock format.  And millisecond and timezone tests are not supported&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The query tests against the modified datetime property of the content.  (Fairly easy to change it and test against the created property or any other custom metadata DataTime property.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three return formats: XML (the default), JSON and HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;XML&lt;/strong&gt; The XML format is a simple structure that returns back the name of the file, the path to the file and the modification date. It is also the default format returned.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;contentItems&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;contentItem name=&apos;simple.doc&apos; path=&apos;/Company Home/test/Portal&apos; modDate=&apos;2010-04-26T16:21:20.612-06:00&apos;/&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;contentItem name=&apos;simpledraft.docx&apos; path=&apos;/Company Home/test/Portal&apos; modDate=&apos;2010-04-26T16:28:44.569-06:00&apos;/&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/contentItems&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  If there is no modified content a simple &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Consolas, Monaco, &apos;Courier New&apos;, Courier, monospace;line-height: 18px;font-size: 12px&quot;&gt;&lt;contentitems /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;is returned.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;JSON &lt;/strong&gt;The JSON object is somewhat similar, a modified object containing a collection of node objects is returned
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;{ &quot;modified&quot;: [
              { &quot;node&quot;: {
                         &quot;name&quot;: &quot;test3.txt&quot;, &quot;path&quot;: &quot;some/path&quot;,&quot;modified&quot;: &quot;2010-03-17T00:05:43.311-06:00&quot;
                        }
              },
              { &quot;node&quot;: {
                        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;test2.txt&quot;, &quot;path&quot;: &quot;some/path&quot;,&quot;modified&quot;: &quot;2010-03-17T15:07:30.301-06:00&quot;
                        }
              }
              ]
    }&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt; This final format is more for testing than actual production use.  It returns a simple html page with a list of modified items. It displays a simple unordered list, where each item is a csv list with key and values seperated by colons.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all of these return formats, the freemaker template processes the returned scriptNodes for a simple collection.  This makes it easy to extend the return with the returned nodes properties to include things like nodeRef, creation date, node icons, download url, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have suggestions for improvements or questions please feel free to comment here or on the google project.  As always I’m willing to open access to the project to those will to help improve the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This second post is coming a bit late, but it is finally here.  I’ve been getting ready for our World Wide Sales Kickoff. We will be kicking off our new fiscal year with great sessions for our worldwide group of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com/partners/&quot;&gt;partners&lt;/a&gt;. I’ll be presenting with two of my EMEA colleagues on Scaling Alfresco.  I’ve chosen to tackle scaling our WCM product.  It might even turn into some great information for a post or two here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This weeks topic is one of the most popular searches that has lead to this blog: How do I enable the Sharepoint Protocol in Alfresco.  At the outset let me tell you: I’m not going to explain how to actually configure the Sharepoint Services in this post, rather I want to point you to resource that take you through all of the steps of enabling the Sharepoint Protocol in Alfresco and how to use it.  These are often over looked resources, but resources that can be really useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first resource is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/w/images/6/62/Installing_and_Configuring_Alfresco_ECM_Community_Edition_3_2_r2.pdf&quot;&gt;Installing and Configuring Alfresco Community Edition&lt;/a&gt; guide found on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Download_Community_Edition&quot;&gt;Alfresco Community Download&lt;/a&gt; page (or on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.alfresco.com/share/page/site/community/dashboard&quot;&gt;Alfresco Content Community Site&lt;/a&gt; [registration required] in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.alfresco.com/share/page/site/community/documentlibrary&quot;&gt;Document Library&lt;/a&gt; under Documentation in the Installation and Configuration folder for your installed release of Alfresco Community.  This guide covers the basics of setting up and runningg Alfresco Community (It is also a preview of the documentation available as part of an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/&quot;&gt;Alfresco Enterprise Subscription&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://network.alfresco.com&quot;&gt;Alfresco Network&lt;/a&gt; site [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com/about/contact/&quot;&gt;Alfresco Enterprise Subscription Required&lt;/a&gt;].)  You’ll find instructions for setting up and configuring Alfresco Sharepoint Services (on the server side) starting on the bottom of page 26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second resource covers using the Sharepoint Extension in Microsoft Office: &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.alfresco.com/share/page/site/community/document-details?nodeRef=workspace://SpacesStore/c655e820-c926-4332-8ce0-9571fc239170&quot;&gt;Managing Alfresco Content from within MS Office Community Edition&lt;/a&gt;. (Requires Registration).  This is also found in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.alfresco.com/share/page/site/community/dashboard&quot;&gt;Alfresco Content Community Site&lt;/a&gt; [registration required] in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://share.alfresco.com/share/page/site/community/documentlibrary&quot;&gt;Document Library&lt;/a&gt; but in the Tutorials folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These documents as well as others for using Share, Web Content Management, Document Management and Records Management can be found in the Content Community Site. You’ll also find presentations from past Community Conferences, Case Studies, White Papers and Webinars.&lt;/p&gt;

New posts will come every Friday and will incorporate some facet of the search terms that brought people to this blog.  The post size will vary based on the question and the technical depth it may require.  Hopefully, this can prove to be valuable. I’ll also add a pitch here for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com/services/consulting/&quot;&gt;Alfresco Professional Services&lt;/a&gt; — bread on the table, mouths to feed and all — we offer the in-depth knowledge you need to help with your &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/&quot;&gt;Alfresco Enterprise Subscription&lt;/a&gt;. So without further ado….I give you: Search’d&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s search terms came in as “alfresco start up disable share studio”.  For most Java Developers who have worked with Java application servers this will be pretty simple — you may even want to find something else to do now.  For those new to Java or not even in the market to learn, it will not be.  But the answer is pretty simple, but first some background…..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java based applications can be packaged into several different formats. Typically you will find JARs and WARs.  In some circumstances they are packaged in other formats as well…RARs and EARs being the most common.  We at Alfresco like to use AMPs (which may or may not actually include Java code) to manager extensions to Alfresco.  These archives are zip files with specific file layouts. Go ahead, take a copy of the alfresco.war file and open it with a archive manager that understands zip.  It won’t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, if you downloaded Alfresco as one of the full blown installers or as a bundle with tomcat, go ahead and run the installer or unpackaged the archive.  Once that is done navigate down into the tomcat/webapps directory.  In there you will see a few directories and a couple of files with the extension .war (alfresco.war, share.war, mobile.war (Community only), studio.war (Community only)).  To disable any of these simply remove the war file or rename it by anding a new/additional extension.  I like to add the extension .off, which lets me clearly see that this part of Alfresco is — off.  Removing the war files also may seem a bit brute force and unless you are really desperate for the space it won’t hurt anything to leave them.  This is my preferred approach.  If you ever want to add that part of Alfresco back, just remove the extension and restart Alfresco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have already started Alfresco you will see directories that match the name of the war file.  You will also need to remove those directories. (Don’t forget to restart Alfresco after removing those directories).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Q:  Is there ever a case where I would disable  the Alfresco application? **Yes.  If you are using Alfresco Share, you can add a bit of scale to your deployment by having Share installed on another server.  It does require some additional configuration, but we won’t cover that today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Q: I just removed &lt;strong&gt;_\&lt;em&gt;_.war!  Or I just removed the ___&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; directory! How do I get it back? **For basic out of the box installs, stop Alfresco and simply grab the war file from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Download_Community_Edition&quot;&gt;Alfresco Community Page&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://network.alfresco.com&quot;&gt;Alfresco Network&lt;/a&gt; (versions must match) and copy it back into the webapps directory.  If you have added extensions via AMPs to your war files, reapply the amps to the new war file. Restart Alfresco.  For the case where you deleted an expanded directory, with the war files in place, restart Alfresco and they will be deployed again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfresco PDF Toolkit, or as I originally named it, &lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.ottleys.net/public/alfresco/pdf-extension/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pdf-extension&lt;/a&gt;, has been around for a while.  It was originally hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.ottleys.net/public&quot;&gt;my SVN server&lt;/a&gt; and in then in &lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.ottleys.net/alfresco&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my Alfresco SVN Repo&lt;/a&gt;.  It was developed as a one-off side project at the request of an early Alfresco customer.  The code has been sitting around with very few updates since that time.  An occasional rebuild to make sure it would work with a new release of Alfresco but that was it. (I think it was original built for 2.1 or 2.2)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the update?&lt;/strong&gt; Focused attention.  It is a way to get my hands dirty and adding some new features that have been rattling around in my head for a while now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**What can it do? **This initial release has three functions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Split PDF — This option allows you to split a PDF every specified number of pages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Split at Page — This option allows you to split a PDF at a specified page&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Merge PDF — This options allows you to append a PDF to another PDF&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three options generate new PDFs leaving the originals untouched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Where can I find these actions? **The actions are available in the Run Action Wizard.  They use the same names as above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the future hold?&lt;/strong&gt; The current list of enhancements is as follows (bot not necessarily in this order):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PDF Watermarks / Rubber stamping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Digital Signatures&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TIFF to PDF transformation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extract Pages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delete Pages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Transform to PDF/A&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I help?&lt;/strong&gt; Yes!  I’m more than happy to accept code contributions or add features the list of enhancements.  And of course, merit can make you a contributor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**Where can I find the code or the AMP again? **In the Google Code Project: &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-pdf-toolkit/&quot;&gt;Alfresco PDF Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

A simple solution is to leverage Java generated [Universally Unique Identifiers][1] (UUID) imported into the [Schema Definition of your form][2] via a [Java Backed Web Script][3]. **Note: **These are not the UUIDs used by Alfresco DM.  UUIDs are not available/part of the AVM/WCM model used by Alfresco.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java Backed Web Scripts provide a powerful way to include complex business process logic, enabling integrations through the [Alfresco Web Script framework][4] using a simple HTTP based API.  In this case, we are using a simple Java class to generate a UUID and then returning that UUID wrapped in a XML Scheme Definition imported through a &lt;xs:include&gt; into a Schema Definition used to generate a form used to capture content in Alfresco&amp;#8217;s WCM service.&lt;/xs:include&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First let’s tackle the Java portion.  This is a simple Java class that extends the Alfresco [DeclarativeWebScript][5] class. A Declarative Web Script allows you to mix Java classes, Freemarker templates (FTL) and Javascript.  In this case we a want to leverage a FTL, which generates the XSD for the return.  Here is the meat of our class:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;public class UUIDWebScript extends DeclarativeWebScript&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
{&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;@Override&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
protected Map executeImpl(WebScriptRequest req,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
Status status, Cache cache)&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
{&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 90px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt; Map model = new HashMap();&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 90px&quot;&amp;gt;UUID uuid = UUID.randomUUID();&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 90px&quot;&amp;gt;model.put(“uuid”, uuid.toString());&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 90px&quot;&amp;gt;return model;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&amp;gt;}&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

Basically,

*   Create a `map` of properties you want to return (by coding conventions this is called a model).
*   Perform your business logic, in our case generate a UUID.
*   Add the values you want to return to the template with a unique name to identify it in the template
*   Return the map of properties

Next we want to format our return.  This is done using a Freemarker Template . ([Freemarker][6] is a Java Based markup language.) Here is ours:

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
xmlns:alfresco=&quot;http://www.alfresco.org/alfresco&quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xs:complexType name=&quot;uuid&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 90px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xs:sequence&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 120px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;xs:element name=&quot;uuid&quot; fixed=&quot;${uuid}&quot; type=&quot;xs:normalizedString&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 90px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;/xs:sequence&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;/xs:complexType&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/xs:schema&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

The FTL, as you can see , is a simple XSD.  The value returned from our Java class, in the model, named uuid, is declared as ${uuid}.

Now let&amp;#8217;s declare the web script so that it can be registered in Alfresco:

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;webscript&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;shortname&amp;gt;Generate UUID&amp;lt;/shortname&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;description&amp;gt;Returns a UUID&amp;lt;/description&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;url&amp;gt;/util/uuid&amp;lt;/url&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;authentication&amp;gt;none&amp;lt;/authentication&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;format default=&quot;xml&quot;&amp;gt;argument&amp;lt;/format&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt; &amp;lt;/webscript&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

And since we are using a Java class in our Web Script, we also need to declare it so that the Web Script framework can use it:

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;beans xmlns=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans&quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;bean id=&quot;webscript.org.alfresco.extension.uuid.uuid.get&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
class=&quot;org.alfresco.extension.uuid.UUIDWebScript&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
parent=&quot;webscript&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/beans&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It is important to note here that the bean id for a Java backed Web Script requires a very specific format:

*   Start by declaring this bean a webscript with: webscript.
*   Next add the full Java package declaration: org.alfresco.extension.uuid
*   Followed by the name used in your FTL and XML declaration with the method used to access the web script: uuid.get
*   When packaged, the FTL and XML declaration must be in a folder structure that matches the Java package declaration.

This puts together all of the pieces on the Web Script side.  It is easiest to manage this through an [AMP file][7], which we won&amp;#8217;t discuss here how to create or install, but [code][8] and [amp file][9] are available at the project page: &amp;lt;http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-uuid-webscript/&amp;gt;

Once installed we can verify that it works by going to http://localhost:8080/alfresco/service/util/uuid in your browser (replace localhost and port as needed for your install).  What you should see returned is an XSD that looks something like this:

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xs:schema xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
xmlns:alfresco=&quot;http://www.alfresco.org/alfresco&quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;&lt;xs:complextype name=&quot;uuid&quot;&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 90px&quot;&gt;&lt;xs:sequence&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 120px&quot;&gt;&lt;xs:element name=&quot;uuid&quot; fixed=&quot;9c2fce39-3351-47c9-bb05-4b002967a00d&quot; type=&quot;xs:normalizedString&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 90px&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/xs:schema&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It is our template but with are declaration of ${uuid} replaced with aUUID: 9c2fce39-3351-47c9-bb05-4b002967a00d.  With each call to this  Web Script you will see a uniquely generated ID.

Now let&amp;#8217;s integrate this with a simple XSD:

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;xs:schema&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
xmlns:alf=&quot;http://www.alfresco.org&quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
xmlns:sample=&quot;http://www.alfresco.org/alfresco/sample&quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
elementFormDefault=&quot;qualified&quot;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
targetNamespace=&quot;http://www.alfresco.org/alfresco/sample&quot;&amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;webscript://util/uuid&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt; &lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xs:element name=&quot;sample&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;xs:complexType&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;xs:sequence&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 90px&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;xs:element name=&quot;sample&quot; type=&quot;xs:normalizedString&quot; minOccurs=&quot;1&quot; maxOccurs=&quot;1&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;xs:element name=&quot;key&quot; type=&quot;sample:uuid&quot;/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 60px&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/xs:sequence&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/xs:complexType&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/xs:element&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/xs:schema&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The important thing here is how we reference the Web Script, and you can do this with any custom Web Script designed to render XML Schema to be included in a form,  by referencing the call with the declaration of webscript:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;xs:include schemaLocation=&quot;webscript://util/uuid&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Add this XSD to your Web Project and give it a run! In the form you will see the UUID, as a read-only field.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-299 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/02/Picture-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;UUID in Web Form&quot; width=&quot;472&quot; height=&quot;128&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left&quot;&gt;
    Now in your XML output you will have a unique key that you can reference in your templates.
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we start to see more deployments of Alfresco in the cloud we are also seeing increased complexity in using features like JMX for managing Alfresco and troubleshooting Alfresco customizations with a Java debugger.  Below are two ways that you can use to enable both on cloud based installs of Alfresco.  These methods can also be used in instances where more security conscious admins have locked down ports, for example in a secured environment.  Also note these methods require an ssh client on your client machine and an ssh daemon on the server.  The instructions provided below assume you are using Linux on the server (which is likely to be the case for most cloud based installs); your client may run Windows, OS X or Linux.  Windows clients will require using ssh clients as provided by [cygwin][2] or [Putty][3], etc. Cygwin will allow you to use the following as described.  For putty, use this description of [tunneling with putty][4] along with the configuration instructions that follow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssh-tunneling-for-debugging&quot;&gt;SSH Tunneling for Debugging&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First configure Alfresco/Tomcat to listen for debug connections as per usual.  Add the following to your &lt;code&gt;alfresco.sh&lt;/code&gt; file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;export JAVA_OPTS=&quot;${JAVA_OPTS} -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=8082&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;address&lt;/code&gt; parameter sets the port you want the debugger to listen on.  Adding this line, will require you to restart Alfresco/tomcat for it to become active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, standard port forwarding with ssh should enable Java debugging:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ssh -i path/to/your.pem -f root@yourhost.com -L 2000:localhost:8082 -N&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this example we are using the following options:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;-i path/to/your.pem&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; If you are using key-based authentication, like with EC2, use this option to point to your private key.  It is optional if you are not.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Have the session move into the background after you connect.  Useful if you need to enter a password or passphrase
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;root@yourhost.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The user and name of the server to connect to.  You do not need to use your root user account.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;-L 2000:localhost:8082&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The first number is the local port that you want to open to listen to connections on. Next is the hostname/IP/DNS name of the server to connect to on the other side of the tunnel and then finally the port to connect to at that address.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;padding-left: 30px&quot;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;-N&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tells ssh to not execute a command upon connection
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we need to connect the debugger.  This example gives instructions for Eclipse.  Configure the debugger using the Remote Java Application option. Accept the default Connection Type: &lt;code&gt;Standard (Socket Attach)&lt;/code&gt;, but for the Connection Properties enter &lt;code&gt;localhost&lt;/code&gt; for the Host and the port number from the first parameter in the &lt;code&gt;-L&lt;/code&gt; switch for Port.  In our example port &lt;code&gt;2000&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;attachment_276&quot; style=&quot;width: 387px&quot; class=&quot;wp-caption aligncenter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;size-full wp-image-276 &quot; src=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/files/2010/02/dhnsnn76_21dt9jhkc7_b.png&quot; alt=&quot;Eclipse Debugger&quot; width=&quot;377&quot; height=&quot;170&quot; /&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;wp-caption-text&quot;&gt;
    Eclipse Debugger
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connect your debugger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ssh-tunneling-for-jmx&quot;&gt;SSH Tunneling for JMX&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This configuration is a bit more complex due to how RMI works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you will need to add the following line to your &lt;code&gt;alfresco.sh&lt;/code&gt; file (Restart required to turn in on):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;export JAVA_OPTS=&quot;${JAVA_OPTS} -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=dummyhost&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may already see the &lt;code&gt;-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote&lt;/code&gt; line in the file, if so just add &lt;code&gt;=true&lt;/code&gt; to it.  This is important as I’ve had difficulty attaching with out this set to true (even though the default value of that option, with out declaring the value is true).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;-Djava.rmi.server.hostname=dummyhost&lt;/code&gt; option is needed to help RMI know where to connect.  RMI connects in a two part process.  First by connecting to the RMI server registry, which pushes your request to the JMX service which is dynamically allocated on the first open port available to it at start up time. Dynamic ports don’t give us the consistence we need so we will want to configure Alfresco to use a static port. Also, this second connection requires us to use/set a hostname to connect, otherwise it will return an IP address, which in the case of EC2 is non-routable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s create a new context file under the &lt;code&gt;extension&lt;/code&gt; directory (&lt;code&gt;tomcat/shared/classes/alfresco/extension&lt;/code&gt;) and call it &lt;code&gt;custom-core-services-context.xml&lt;/code&gt;.  In that file we will add the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;`&lt;?xml version=&apos;1.0&apos; encoding=&apos;UTF-8&apos;?&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC ‘-//SPRING//DTD BEAN//EN’ ‘http://www.springframework.org/dtd/spring-beans.dtd’&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;beans&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;!-- MBeanServer Connector Override (registers itself with custom alfrescoMBeanServer) --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;bean id=&quot;serverConnector&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
depends-on=&quot;registry&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
lazy-init=&quot;true&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;property name=&quot;server&quot; ref=&quot;alfrescoMBeanServer&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;property name=&quot;objectName&quot;  value=&quot;connector:name=rmi&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;property name=&quot;serviceUrl&quot;  value=&quot;service:jmx:rmi://localhost:${jmx.port.number}/jndi/rmi://localhost:${alfresco.rmi.services.port}/alfresco/jmxrmi&quot; /&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;property name=&quot;environment&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;map&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!-- The following keys are only valid when sun jmx is used --&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;entry key=&quot;jmx.remote.x.password.file&quot; value=&quot;${alfresco.jmx.dir}/alfresco-jmxrmi.password&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;entry key=&quot;jmx.remote.x.access.file&quot;   value=&quot;${alfresco.jmx.dir}/alfresco-jmxrmi.access&quot;/&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/map&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/property&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;`

The important value in here is `jmx.port.number`.  To set this value add `jmx.port.number=50508` to the `alfresco-global.properties` file (located in `tomcat/shared/classes`)

Next you will want to add the hostname you entered above into your `/etc/hosts file`:

`127.0.0.1    dummyhost`

Remember we do this because during the second part of establishing an RMI connection, RMI returns the hostname we want to connect to.  In our case this is the local client that is forwarding the connection to the server machine that is running Alfresco.

Now start Alfresco and let&amp;#8217;s configure ssh to forward the ports.  This requires two new tunnels:

`ssh -i path/to/your.pem -f root@yourhost.com -L 2001:localhost:50500 -N`

`ssh -i path/to/your.pem -f root@yourhost.com -L dummyhost:50508:localhost:50508 -N`

The same explanations to these commands found in the debug section above apply here as well.  But notice one difference in the second tunnel.  The second tunnel is specifying the hostname to connect to: `dummyhost`.  Remember we are doing this because RMI will be returning the hostname as specified in our `alfresco.sh` file.  We need to tell the tunnel how to use that hostname.  Also, the port we want to have listening locally is the same as the port that will be listening remotely.

Finally, when you connect your JMX console to Alfresco use the standard connection string but for the hostname use `localhost` and the port number, `2001`, specified in the first tunnel:

`service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:2001/alfresco/jmxrmi`

&lt;p&gt;She would take the images, print them and put them in albums.  I would take them and post them on our website.  After a while as the number of kids exploded and the significant number of events in our lives grew, we knew we needed a better way to keep up with and share all the pictures.  With the ease of taking (and deleting) pictures, we had put together a nice collection of images that we wanted to share with friends and family.  We had just moved to Utah and had lots of family that were now farther away from us.  I took an old computer and set it up with &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.menalto.com/&quot;&gt;Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.  We have been very happy with &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.ottleys.net&quot;&gt;our gallery site&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.ottleys.net&quot;&gt;http://gallery.ottleys.net&lt;/a&gt;.  We’ve amassed a lot of images.  We’ve also played with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.flickr.com/photos/jottley&quot;&gt;Flickr&lt;/a&gt; and put some in Facebook.  But we lacked a real showcase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About a year ago, I made in investment in a DSLR and the number of pictures we were taking jumped…a lot.  We bought extra disk space to accommodate the growth.  But I still wanted a place to put some of the better pictures.  I’ve been playing with photoblogging software off and on for a while.  This weekend I decided to nail it down. (Sorry for the Twitter/Facebook/Feed SPAM.) I worked through some options in WordPress, our chosen blogging platform, and decided it wasn’t really what I wanted.  While I was looking for templates to use/customize for WordPress I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pixelpost.org/&quot;&gt;Pixelpost&lt;/a&gt;.  I knew pretty quickly this was what I wanted.  It is a “simple” PHP-based photoblogging platform.  It’s open source, always a plus.  It supports content/comment moderation and has an add-on architecture.  It also supports, through an add-on, Adobe Lightroom export directly to your Pixelpost site, which greatly simplifies my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado, I’d like to introduce &lt;a href=&quot;http://photography.ottleys.net&quot;&gt;photography.ottleys.net&lt;/a&gt;. My goal is to share a picture or two a day.  I’ll of course fiddle with the layout, play with functionality and hopefully add some value to the pixelpost community.  (I’ve already started to brainstorm about how it could be used in conjunction with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com&quot;&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;. –I know, I have a one track mind.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope you enjoy our little corner of the web and that this new site will be a lot of fun…..at least for me.&lt;/p&gt;

A couple weeks back we released the Alfresco Community V3.2 for Ubuntu </summary><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**NOTE: **This instructions apply to Jaunty Jackalope (9.04).  The package is currently being updated for Karmic Koala (9.10).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;UPDATED:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; *Added note about applying amp files.&lt;br /&gt;
*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple weeks back we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com/media/releases/2009/07/ubuntu/&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_Community_Edition_3.2&quot;&gt;Alfresco Community V3.2 &lt;/a&gt;for Ubuntu package. The package was developed in conjunction with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.canonical.com&quot;&gt;Canonical&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve been working on this for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/news/alfresco-enterprise-content-management&quot;&gt;while&lt;/a&gt;, but now have in place a general structure that will enable us to deliver updates to the package in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which version of Ubuntu? What is installed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This initial release is packaged for Ubuntu 9.04 (Jaunty Jackalope).  There maybe some back ports coming for older Ubuntu releases but nothing definite at this time.  The idea is to make Alfresco Community easy to install, with most functionality available right out of the box.  We’ve made a concerted effort to use base packages from the Jaunty distro, only adding ours when needed. The major packages that are installed when Alfresco is installed are: Tomcat 6, Sun Java 6, Mysql 5.1, OpenOffice.org 3 (Headless), ImageMagick, pdf2swf (from swftools — this is our own packaged version of the devel branch.  It will be replaced with the next release of swftools when it is updated in the base of the distro).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Do I Install It?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The alfresco-community package is located in the Ubuntu partner repository.  &lt;em&gt;These instructions assume that you are using the command line.&lt;/em&gt; You can also use an X-Windows desktop to install alfresco.  If you do, some of the steps are a bit different, but the general outline can be grasped from these instructions. So let’s start…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can add the partner repository by editing &lt;code&gt;/etc/apt/sources.list&lt;/code&gt;. You need to uncomment the partner repo:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace, &apos;Times New Roman&apos;, &apos;Bitstream Charter&apos;, Times, fantasy&quot;&gt;deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu jaunty partner&lt;br /&gt; deb-src http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu jaunty partner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you need to add the signed repository key:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace, &apos;Times New Roman&apos;, &apos;Bitstream Charter&apos;, Times, fantasy&quot;&gt;sudo apt-key adv –keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com –recv-keys E048451D9EE6D873&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refresh the apt cache for the newly added repository:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace, &apos;Times New Roman&apos;, &apos;Bitstream Charter&apos;, Times, fantasy&quot;&gt;sudo apt-get update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can now install Alfresco:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: monospace, &apos;Times New Roman&apos;, &apos;Bitstream Charter&apos;, Times, fantasy&quot;&gt;apt-get install alfresco-community&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will be prompted to enter the mysql admin password, to accept the Sun Java license, configure the alfresco database username and password (the default is to choose alfresco/alfresco), allow for the automatic configuration of tomcat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once complete, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_Explorer&quot;&gt;Alfresco Explorer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_Share&quot;&gt;Alfresco Share&lt;/a&gt; will be available by pointing your browser to &lt;code&gt;http://&amp;lt;IP Adresses or DNS Name&amp;gt;:8080/alfresco&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;http://&amp;lt;IP Adresses or DNS Name&amp;gt;:8080/share&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where does everything get put?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using one of the default linux installs from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com&quot;&gt;www.alfresco.com&lt;/a&gt;, you will typically find alfresco installed under &lt;code&gt;/opt/alfresco&lt;/code&gt;.  By using the default tomcat, shipped with ubuntu, we followed its directory/configuration structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alfresco indexes and contentstore:&lt;/strong&gt; The Alfresco indexes and contentstore can be found under &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/alfresco&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alfresco war files:&lt;/strong&gt; The alfresco and share war files can be found under &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/tomcat6/webapps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alfresco extension directories:&lt;/strong&gt; The extension directory, where you should make configuration changes to alfresco and share, can be found under &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/tomcat6/shared&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alfresco log files:&lt;/strong&gt; The alfresco log files can be found under &lt;code&gt;/var/log/tomcat6&lt;/code&gt;
Many of these directories are symbolic links to directories under &lt;code&gt;/usr/share/tomcat6&lt;/code&gt;. However, the default tomcat configuration points to the &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/tomcat6&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using the default tomcat we gain the advantage of an out of the box init script to control start and stop of Alfresco.  You can now use &lt;code&gt;/etc/init.d/tomcat start|stop|restart|try-restart|force-reload|status&lt;/code&gt; to control or check the status of  the tomcat server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the startup parameters of tomcat or those of Alfresco, (ie. memory settings, configuring JMX, etc.) modify the JAVA_OPTS variable in &lt;code&gt;/etc/default/tomcat6&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomcat is run using a non-root user.  This means that Alfresco cannot open the ports needed for CIFS, FTP, or NFS. Follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/File_Server_Configuration#Running_SMB.2FCIFS_from_a_normal_user_account&quot;&gt;instructions to configure alfresco and iptables&lt;/a&gt; to listen on non-standard ports and perform port forwarding. (Look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidbaker.cc/&quot;&gt;David Baker’s blog&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidbaker.cc/?q=node/3&quot;&gt;step by step instructions on how to configure Alfresco CIFs with port forwarding using iptables&lt;/a&gt;.) The same use of non standard ports and iptables configurations should be applied to inbound &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Inbound_Email_Server_Configuration&quot;&gt;SMTP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/IMAP&quot;&gt;IMAP&lt;/a&gt; configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lagniappe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few other important things to note&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AMP Files&lt;/strong&gt; – One noticeable difference is that there is no apply_amps script.  This is an oversight on my part and will be corrected in the next release.  Meantime, if you want to apply an &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/AMP_Files&quot;&gt;AMP&lt;/a&gt;, you can &lt;a href=&quot;http://process.alfresco.com/ccdl/?file=release/community/build-2039/alfresco-mmt-3.2.jar&quot;&gt;download the MMT tool&lt;/a&gt; and follow the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Module_Management_Tool&quot;&gt;instructions to install AMPs with MMT&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; After applying an amp you will need to stop the alfresco server, remove the existing alfresco directory (&lt;code&gt;rm -rf /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/alfresco&lt;/code&gt;) and start alfresco. The new war file which contains the amps will then be deploy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Studio &amp;amp; Mobile&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Web_Studio&quot;&gt;Alfresco Web Studio&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_Community_Edition_3.2#Mobile_client_for_iPhones&quot;&gt;Alfresco Mobile&lt;/a&gt; are not included in the current package.  They will be included in the next release.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the future hold?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan we are discussing would be to provide the core repository and Alfresco Explorer as the central package, with separate packages for share, mobile, web studio, WCM and the filesystem receiver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are also open for suggestions.  Let us know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

As Dr. Suarez sits on the couch next to Dr. Artis, the camera pans to catch the coffee table in front of the couch. Here is the screen capture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They both have school friends on the team. Andrew gave one of his friends a great big hug when he saw him. Taylor has one of his best friends from last years team and first grade class. The coach is quite serious about the game, which I really like. It is still very early to tell if this will be their sport.

The migration, while it took time, was rather easy. I combined our separate blogs all under a WordPress MU install to simplfy maintenance. One thing that I am happy about with the upgrade, besides improved performance, is that the iPhone wordpress app now works. I had errors connecting before. One thing that helped in configuring the app is improved error handling in the latest version. The initial release would always just die when trying to connect with no errors. I tried sniffing the connection, but unsuccesfully. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I contiunue to use the app, I’ll update you on to what I like and don’t like. For now I’m happy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of what I write here &lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/alfresco/evaluating-with-a-virtual-appliance&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;refers back&lt;/a&gt; to when I original put together, the first version of the appliance.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing a distribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started playing with building an appliance right about the time that Ubuntu announced their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/serveredition/jeos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jeos distribution&lt;/a&gt;. I have a strong preference for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensuse.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt; and would have liked to have built the appliance on it. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.opensuse.org/LimeJeos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LimeJEOS&lt;/a&gt; answers my concerns, and I am excited to give it a spin. Just a few more things to move off my plate before I can devote time to it.) I tried several different distributions: &lt;a href=&quot;http://fedoraproject.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Fedora&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensuse.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ubuntu.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.puppylinux.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Puppy Linux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zenwalk.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zen Walk&lt;/a&gt;. I liked some, was optimistic about others, and disappointed and frustrated with a couple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I wanted was a distribution that provided me a small lightweight base, and gives me the ability to add just the packages I needed to run my application. Most of these came in close to what I wanted, but due to dependencies, grew to be much larger than I wanted. Some didn’t even provide me with a nice clean way to get the applications I was dependent on. Those I dropped immediately. Those with decent package mangers got pluses. I wanted to be to keep base packages up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This brings us to Ubuntu Jeos (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Just Enough OS&lt;/a&gt;). It gave me the size, the packages, and the manager that met my base criteria for a distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the base install is already fairly small, there still are many packages that I was going to need and not need. This takes some time, but go through the installed packages and identify what you aren’t and are going to need. Make a list and develop a script to remove the ones you don’t need. Another to add the ones you need. You may like to have some of the packages around while developing your appliance, but when you go to deliver it they may add more weight than what you would like, or give tools that just aren’t need by your appliance, or your end users. Keep them installed until you are sure they aren’t needed any more. My list includes: man pages, wireless-tools, sound packages, laptop packages, different editors, hardware utilities, etc. Your list will vary. Sometimes you may want to force remove dependent packages if you know their functionality is not needed. Don’t be afraid to take them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know my list is not perfect, but over time it will improve. Some of this will come with trial and error. Don’t expect to get it right the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I narrowed the package list, I started to add my dependent packages. Some of these could require you to re-add removed packages. That is why I suggest leaving packages installed until you have all your dependencies installed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the cornerstones of an appliance is zero configuration. You want people to be able to just deploy the appliance, start it and use the appliance. In the case of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt;, it needs &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomcat.apache.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Tomcat&lt;/a&gt; to be started at boot time. For this I needed an &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_startup_process#Init_process_.28SysV_init_style_only.29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;init script&lt;/a&gt;. (Mine can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.ottleys.net/public/alfresco/init/ubuntu/alfresco&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) I use the init script to start Tomcat, start needed services, and perform runtime configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfresco is a web-based application, so I need a way to provide the URL needed by users to access the application. For an appliance this can be changed from install to install. There are several ways to handle this, eventual, you will want to have a static address or use Dynamic DNS to update IP to name mappings. My appliances is primarily for evaluation. It is not really ideal to play with DNS or static IPs. I have kept the implementation simple, I’ve created a script that updates the /etc/issue file with runtime URL. (The script I use is &lt;a href=&quot;http://svn.ottleys.net/public/alfresco/appliance/update-issue&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) The major issue I faced was when the script was to be run. I placed the script in /etc/network/if-up.d. I fully expected it to be run when the interface came up. The script did run when I manually ran ifup. But it didn’t run in every case, especially the most import, at boot time. I tried several different things to work through this. I added a reference to the script into /etc/network/interfaces using the post-up directive. (in openSUSE, you would add a POST_UP_SCRIPT=”&lt;name of=&quot;&quot; your=&quot;&quot; script=&quot;&quot;&gt;&amp;#8221; to the interface file in /etc/sysconfig/network and put the script in /etc/sysconfig/network/scripts). This added a bit more power, but did quite fix my problem. I finally narrowed it down to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Udev&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;udev&lt;/a&gt;. The interface was being brought up by udev, but when /etc/init.d/networking is run, it runs ifup with a -a option (all interfaces marked auto). The problem with this is if the interface is already up, the associated scripts won&amp;#8217;t be run. I haven&amp;#8217;t found an appropriate fix for this yet. (Any ideas?) So I just disabled the udev rule for the network interfaces . &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rpath.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rPath&lt;/a&gt; has a good solution for this, they change /etc/issue file in an init script. I like this idea, but didn&amp;#8217;t want to write another init script or pollute my existing alfresco init script with this.&lt;/name&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plans for the Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I want to do is provide some Alfresco branding to the appliance. I also want to create some more production ready appliances that use MySQL and point at an external virtual drive to store content and the indexes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Missing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the big things that is missing in a management interface for the appliance. rPath provides a very nice extensible &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/rPath_Appliance_Platform_Agent&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;web-based administrative interface&lt;/a&gt;. It is extensible both for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/rPath_Appliance_Platform_Agent:Plugins&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;function&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/rPath_Appliance_Platform_Agent:Branding&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;branding&lt;/a&gt;. But it is rPath specific. I’d like to see an open source cross distro solution. One that was not only extensible but adds &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Information_Model_%28computing%29&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;CIM based management&lt;/a&gt; features. This would make it easy to administer the CIM instrumented applications on the appliance, but also could allow it to be managed externally, but CIM enabled management tools. This would allow the appliance to play nicely in the data center. This is &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.xensource.com/xenwiki/XenCim&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; that Xen is working toward.&lt;/p&gt;

(I am, however, keen to try out &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.opensuse.org/LimeJeos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LimeJeos&lt;/a&gt; based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensuse.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When it first starts, Alfresco will take a few minutes to come up fully. It is creating the initial DB. Subsequent restarts are quicker.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is an evaluation appliance. So once you start it, you have 30-days before the trial expires.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the appliance first starts it will ask you if you copied or moved the appliance. The correct answer is moved it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look for other (community) appliances in the next month or so. I also have some RPMs for Alfresco Community in the works (using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://build.opensuse.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;openSUSE Build Serivce&lt;/a&gt;). I’ll post more this evening about what I learned since the last time I built the appliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I thought that it would be fun to install one or two games on my machine for those times that I need at little escape.  Big mistake.  I installed a First Person Shooter (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idsoftware.com/games/wolfenstein/rtcw/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&lt;/a&gt;) and within 5 minutes knew why I stopped playing.  I loved first person shooters.  I used to play network games with the guys I worked with at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Courts&lt;/a&gt;.  It was a great break from work and a fun team building exercise.  From time to time I would get a little motion sick.  But today I got very motion sick.  I am still suffering from a huge headache playing the game brought on.  The quick jolting motion just seemed to much for me.  Man I am getting old.  Maybe if I take some motion sickness pills next time…..&lt;/p&gt;

(Try running with two kids in a double strolle, with all their carry-on, plus your own across 2 concourses.  Not fun.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So they put me up in a Comfort Suites.  Not the nicest place, but it is a bed.  Up at 5:30 to get my shuttle back to the airport.  Now waiting for seat confirmation.  I want to be on this flight.  I am ready to be home.  It is funny, I can complain about the noise the kids make…all the time….at home.  But these trips bring home to me that I wouldn’t want it any other way.  The quiet of the hotel gets to me.  I love being able to sit down and have one of the kids to talk to.  I love in the morning have Olivia come into my office, give me a hug, and ask for breakfast. I love talking computer games with with boys, or playing Go with Taylor. I love having Adrienne next to me.  I miss her the most.  It will be good to be back home.&lt;/p&gt;

Ph</summary><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;I’m going to try to hit on a couple of topics, mostly dealing with system inefficiencies. (I think I understand some system inefficiencies…I worked as a Systems Analyst for the US Federal Courts…let’s just say they are ripe with them.) These were all exposed during a visit to my local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;
**&lt;br /&gt;
Pharmacy**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a suggestion to streamline my interaction with you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, you are a huge nation wide chain, with interconnected systems, to allow transfer of valuable data between locations. This is awesome. No matter where I am in the country, if I need a refill of a prescription, by answering a few questions I can get that needed chemical for whatever ails me. But your work with my personal information is…well…dismal. I myself have not had to have a prescription filled in quite sometime. But I am a father of 6. I need lots of drugs for sick kids, and their mother. Pregnancy has never treated her well. It has, in half of the cases, been a violent, near death experience for mother and/or child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last three years we have moved 3 times (across the country, across town and across the valley). There have also been three job changes, and three insurance changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My insurance company knows I have dependents and knows their relationship to me and it would be valuable if you did too. If you did, I wouldn’t have to expend valuable time each time I go to you for you to update insurance and address information. If I come in and tell you I have an insurance change, instead of changing it for just the individual I am filling a prescription for, ask me if this change needs to be applied across all the dependents (and myself) in the system. It is a simple enough database transaction across the records. It would be easy enough to even allow for the use case, where I need you to exclude changes to specific individuals. But over all, you get to cut down on the 20+ minutes I wait while you update an individuals records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ugh, this irks me. I am the owner of this information. I am an authority on this information, use my knowledge and my proximity to you at this point in time to update your records and improve the overall customer experience. I am willing  to spend the time with you to do this once so I won’t have to do with each visit I make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The insurance company&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am grateful to have insurance, and while the insurance I have now is not nearly as good as what I have had in the past, I am more grateful to have than to have not. However….I trust you, insurance company, magnitudes less than I trust my physician (especially my children’s pediatrician). I understand that you are trying to save me money, by saving you money. But, if my Physician, who I know and interact with, prescribes medication for my son to help him stay out of the hospital, saving you (and me) money, don’t second guess his recommendation and tell me I have to get a different prescription because you think that I should have one drug before I can have another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a nameless, faceless machine. I have no trust relationship with you. You have in interest in my well being that keeps you in the black. But your primary interest is in your bottom line. You provide a valuable service. Thank you. But my physician is someone I have built a relationship of trust with.  He take the time to help ensure my health and well being. When I see him outside of the office, he takes time to say hello and ask about me and my families well being. He has earned my trust so that I still drive through two different cities to see him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a phone number, a card, a PO Box, a deduction on my paycheck, and a different voice each time I call for information or try to dispute your denial of my care. Please learn to trust my physician and maybe I will learn to trust you.&lt;/p&gt;

But there just wasn’t anything that sounded right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agreed early on that we liked Parker, and had settled on Mathew Parker. About a month ago, Adrienne came to me with a suggestion, earlier this year I lost my grandfather, and Adrienne suggested that we change the name we had chosen so that we could honor my grandfather. It wasn’t a hard decision. We hadn’t told my step-grandmother about the decision to change his name. I got this forward, written by my step-grandmother, to me by my mom today:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I was so moved to learn that Jared and Adrienne named their son Parker &lt;strong&gt;Forrest&lt;/strong&gt; Ottley. Jared has always been so good about keeping in touch with his Grandpa. It means so much that he has honored his Grandpa in this way. Please tell him that I love him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parker’s pediatrician thinks that he could be coming home soon.  He may be going under &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;bilirubin&lt;/a&gt; lights tomorrow for a bit.  He is started to look a little jaundiced.  It is highly likely that he will be coming home this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrienne’s doctor discharged her tonight.  Now the tough part begins: getting her to stay off her feet.  We went straight from hospital a to hospital b to see Parker.  It was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.ottleys.net/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=9616&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;first time&lt;/a&gt; she had a chance to hold him.  I thought I had taken a movie with the camera, but it doesn’t look like it saved it.  Adrienne was able to feed Parker.  He latched right on.  They were worried that he would not have developed his sucking reflex yet.  He ate for close to 20 minutes.  We will go back tomorrow a couple of times for feedings.  In the meantime Adrienne will continue to pump for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameron, Andrew and Olivia were still awake when we got home.  (Olivia keeps running into the bedroom to say “I love you mommy!”)  It will be a big surprise for Taylor and Sawyer tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrienne just discovered two staples that were left in her.  We tried to remove one with tweezers, I was trying to convince her to let me use wire snips to pop the staple in order to pull them out.  She is not to keen on that idea.  One of the two is a lot tighter, so she just wants to go see her doctor tomorrow to have him remove them.  It’s too bad, I think it would be fun to pop them out with a pair of needle nose pliers and wire snips.&lt;/p&gt;

I went up and spent some time with him this evening. He looks a lot like Cameron. He has spikey hair and lots of it. We finally have a length for him: 19 inches. If he went to term, he would have been out biggest baby. We are hoping that he will be home by the end of the week. I have updated the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.ottleys.net/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=9616&quot;&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.ottleys.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt; with ones I took this evening of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrienne is also doing well. She got two more units of blood, but they took the IV out (of her right arm) after they finished. She is still getting liquids by IV (in her left arm). I took the kids up to see her today. They were all happy to see her and I know she loved the company. The doctor has put her on more pain medication. It is painful for her to move around. The doctor said that it could be months before she is fully recovered. He also indicated that if she continues her upward trend, the earliest she could be home would be Wednesday. It will be nice to have her home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At about 1:35 pm she gave birth to Parker Forrest. We know that he is 6 lbs., but not his length yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First Mom: Adrienne’s uterus ruptured and her placenta and the baby had moved into her abdomen. Five minutes longer and I would be writing this as a single father of five. She lost about half of her blood volume. She is on her second transfusion and probably will need a couple more. She is in shock, and they are treating her accordingly, but is stabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Baby: The Doctor’s are saying that we should name the baby Lucky, because he really is lucky (read miracle) that he is with us. He is not out of the woods either. He will probably need a transfusion as well. He lost blood when he involuntarily moved from the uterus to the abdomen. He is being moved from the hospital where he was born to one where they can have him on a ventilator. We are not sure how long he will be there, but he will be there for at least a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me: It is starting to catch up to me. I am working with people to get some stability for the rest of the kids and for me. As things progress I will update you all. At some point I will get some decent pictures to put up for everyone to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.ottleys.net/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=9616&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Parker Forrest Photo Gallery &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mom is doing well. Drowsy and sore, but her bleeding is down to what is to be expected.  Parker is at his new hospital.  He is breathing without a respirator.  He is doing quite well.  I am hoping they will both be home soon.&lt;/p&gt;

I, on the other hand, have been using Vonage as my home phone for nearly 3 years and am very happy with it. One of the important things for someone who works at home (and is taking care of family while his &lt;a href=&quot;http://adrienne.ottleys.net&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; is on bed rest) is staying in contact. I installed the Skype mobile client on my phone. It is great. I can stay in contact while I am taking kids to and from school/activities. It is a bit of a battery hog but well worth it. A week or so ago, I went to lunch with the younger of my kids (those not is school) and Adrienne. (Yes, she is on bed rest, but she can get a bit stir crazy and so I try to get her out of the house once a week for a meal not prepared by me.) While at lunch one of the sales guys IMs me over Skype, that he needs someone to take a call to answer some questions. I mention that I am not near a computer (it is lunch time) and that if the call needs that kind of attention it will be a few minutes before I can get home to call the potential customer. He assures me that it won’t need that kind of attention and then pauses, “Wait, if you are not near a computer…how was I just chatting with you over Skype?!” After a few quick pointers on where to look and I can feel the excitement over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This conversation reminds me that I ought to check and see if there is an update to the version of Skype I am using on my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.samsungblackjack.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phone&lt;/a&gt;. When I check, I see that Skype has partnered with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iskoot.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iSkoot&lt;/a&gt; for a new mobile client. This I need to try. It is a complete rewrite, cutting out some of the battery hogging features and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iskoot.com/products.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;enabling things&lt;/a&gt; like calls over your mobile line to Skype users. Now I don’t have to worry so much about the quality when I am on an edge network instead of G or 3G network. So I decide this is something worth trying and go to install it. Let’s just say that the install process left much to be desired. After a lot of tries, I finally got it installed. I haven’t tried it since, but I want to say it was a temporary network issue, &lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/alfresco/alfresco-website-and-email-down&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;not that Alfresco hasn’t had our own issues in this regard&lt;/a&gt;. Now that it is installed, I am quite happy with it. It is easy to use. Call clarity is good. And battery life….there is a huge change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a mobile phone, and you use Skype and can afford the data fees, it is well worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alfresco Wiki&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Although the Alfresco Add-Ins have been designed with Microsoft Office 2003 in mind, they are compatible with Microsoft Office 2007, with the following caveats:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Before installing the Add-Ins, ensure the &lt;strong&gt;.NET Programmability Support&lt;/strong&gt; option has been installed for each of the Office applications you are installing the add-ins for. Normally these will be Word, Excel and PowerPoint. 
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;The options can be found by running the Office Setup program and expanding the list of available options for each application.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;You may need your original Office 2007 install media in order to add these essential components.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;

The add-on is actually launching a web browser that hooks into these MS Office Applications. Web Scripts are a powerful integration point for Alfresco. (Search &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=alfresco+web+scripts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for write ups on Web Scripts.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alfresco add-in allows you to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;

      &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;browse the repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;search within the repository&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;open, save, delete content&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;access version history and compare versions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;transform documents to PDFs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;start workflows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;insert documents into an existing document (think of a folder with documents that are actually standard response to RFP or RFI questions, you can insert these responses directly into the RFP/RFI using the add-in.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;blockquote&gt;

      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfresco is normally a zero-foot print install on the client side (You use your browser and/or mapped drive into the repository.) But this is really worth the 6MB for the whole bundle.&lt;/p&gt;

My response is at the end. (Just to note, I grew up in New Orleans and some of my wife’s family is still there.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How do we pass a law?&lt;br /&gt;
Very Fair URINE TEST…&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;(I sure would like to know who wrote this one! They deserve a HUGE pat on the back!)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Like a lot of folks in this state, I have a job. I work, they pay me. I pay my taxes and the government distributes my taxes as it sees fit. In order to get that paycheck, I am required to pass a random urine test with which I have no problem. What I do have a problem with is the distribution of my taxes to people who don’t have to pass a urine test. Shouldn’t one have to pass a urine test to get a welfare check because I have to pass one to earn it for them? Please understand, I have no problem with helping people get back on their feet. I do, on the other hand, have a problem with helping someone sitting on their BUTT , doing drugs, while I work. . . . Can you imagine how much money the state would save if people had to pass a urine test to get a public assistance check.&lt;br /&gt;
Pass this along if you agree or simply delete if you don’t. Hope you all will pass it along, though . . . something has to change in this country — and soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let us say that, maybe, 25% of the people getting a welfare check are abusing. (Which would be a staggering number [&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]). Do you think that this would really save money? Here is how I see it breaking down:&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;0/ We have increased costs, paying people to collect, process and administer urine tests&lt;br /&gt;
1/ We have also increased the illegal urine trade &lt;img src=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;;-)&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
2/ Storage of all the data (Just think urine warehouses) [&lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;br /&gt;
3/ We have people disputing the results (I had a poppy seed muffin top in the waiting room!) Which means more attorneys, more testing, more money!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;And what does this result in? Either, you lost all of your cost savings or, you have increased your costs. And who pays for increased government costs? You, and your children, and your children’s children and their children’s children…..&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;But on the other hand, you have created new jobs and could reduce the number those that need welfare [&lt;a href=&quot;#4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]. So it could be a boom to the economy!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;This could be just the thing we need to stop the recession we are about to experience.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;/me&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;PS I have *never* had to have a urine test for any of my employers. (White collar workers have it so easy….sitting on our butts, getting fat, looking at youtube, all day long!)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;1&quot; name=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; “Since TANF was enacted, the number of people on welfare has declined dramatically. By 1999, there were only 7.2 million recipients, including 2.6 million families and 5.1 million children, roughly half the caseload of the 1994 peak..” &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.policyalmanac.org/social_welfare/welfare.shtml&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.policyalmanac.org/social_welfare/welfare.shtml&lt;/a&gt; (I know the numbers don’t add, but they are not suppose to. You aren’t actually suppose to add them. They are sliced representations of he total. )&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;2&quot; name=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt; Additional tests could be run to match urine to an individual. (We don’t need any more pregnant men, menopausal 20/30 year old women, etc ) So, 0/ You could have someone watch them pee (another person you have to pay and monitor. They could be taking bribes, peeing in the cup for you!). 1/ You could DNA test, mouth swab, which you could then type to the urine sample (this results in more tests, more people to administer it, etc. which means more costs)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;3&quot; name=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; This might be a good thing. The real estate market is coming crashing down. More companies are going out of business, downsizing, off shoring and near shoring. There could be a lot of [refrigerated] warehouse space available on the market (do you know of any?) It could also be a boom to the construction market, building more warehouses. (I can’t think of any major cities in the US that need major reconstruction efforts at the moment, so the construction workers should be available to build new ones.) There is a lot of land, I understand, available in St. Bernard Parish. But if you built the urine storage facilities down there, what happens if you have another hurricane come through? Just think of all the pee and all the plastic cups! Al Gore would be livid.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;4&quot; name=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt; There are so many trained urine techs on the dole these days. You could train new ones. But they would need to be urine tested as well. Where could we find them? Oh yeah! The people on welfare, they need jobs, but we just accused them of using drugs (and remember 25% of them are) are we sure we want former drug addicts running urine tests?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some highlights:


  Employees are increasingly communicating on social-net</summary><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Alfresco formally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com/media/releases/2007/11/facebook/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its Facebook integration yesterday.   The press release goes into why we think that this is significant and what we think the future of the enterprise and social networking has in store for us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some highlights:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Employees are increasingly communicating on social-networking platforms – outside the control of the corporate IT department. Corporations must choose either to ban social software use or to harness the potential to communicate more effectively with their community of customers, partners and employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;From an enterprise perspective, organizations must have the ability to publish to a Facebook audience as effectively as to a Web site audience. From an employee perspective, forward-looking enterprises believe that social networking provides a ready-made knowledge-management platform for their workers, which will increase adoption rates to the levels that knowledge management was always meant to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agree or disagree, social networks will/are having an affect on the enterprise.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.windley.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Phil Windley&lt;/a&gt;, pointed out yesterday on &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=7031&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BTL&lt;/a&gt;, the power in integration between search and facebook type social network platforms.  He said,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  Facebook has more than a good record of my personal traits and attributes. They also know about my relationships.  Would you be willing to reveal your social network to Yahoo! or Google? For most of us, the answer depends on what we’d get in return. How about friend recommendations on products?
&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  Imagine a system that knew what your friends were buying and ordered product search results accordingly. You could tweak it, perhaps, with information about who’s recommendation you trusted in what categories.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
  Now an ECM could also take advantage of this, sharing your content with your friends, and others in your extended networks.  Your personalized search engine could be pulling back content target at your employees, customers and partners, placing content at the finger tips of those whom you trust, associate with and sell to.
&lt;/p&gt;

This first release is based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://ftp.heanet.ie/disk1/ubuntu-cdimage/jeos/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JeOS&lt;/a&gt; as a VMware VM. I need to dig into &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.opensuse.org/KIWI&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kiwi&lt;/a&gt; and see if I can build out the same thing with openSUSE. I think that Fedora has a utility to do something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of things to think about when planning a virtual appliance: size, dependencies, easy of use, what you want end-users to be able to do with the appliance, etc. I have gone back and forth on trade-offs. Initially, I would like to see the appliance as a quick and easy way for someone to evaluate Alfresco. So I stuck with HSQL for the DB. I removed a nice chunk of packages that I would not expect anyone to be using during an evaluation of Alfresco. I think key is keeping them focused. If you are trying to do everything with Alfresco you are bound to get distracted. One of the things that you want with an evaluation is that it just works. While there is a log in prompt, I have the appliance report back, on boot, the most important information they need to try out Alfresco: The URL to access Alfresco. Just point your browser at the URL provided. Everything self-contained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VM has Alfresco DM and WCM installed. I haven’t loaded it up with all the cool add-ons, etc. While that would be fun, it takes space, and keeps from the focus: The basic/core functionality of the repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still need to cut down on the size, learn how to better package VMs and make them work under multiple VM managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. If you download this and you feel you really need the login credentials and can’t figure them out….let me know I will be glad to send them to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the add-on installed, you can designate a folder that contains content (HTML or text files) that can be posted to a defined blog.  But that is not where the strength of the Alfresco integration comes.  The strength of using Alfresco to manage your content comes in the Alfresco feature set.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All of the blog content can be versioned&lt;/strong&gt;.  During the creation phase/life of your blog articles, the content can be &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Versioning&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;versioned&lt;/a&gt;.  If an article is being worked on by multiple people in the system, you can keep track of who made changes and what those changes are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content can be managed as part of a workflow&lt;/strong&gt;.   I have seen potential blog posts from management and developers being passed around for review in email.  There is no accountability in that.  There is no way to track where it went and what comment/modifications are being made along the way.  And it really would stink if important changes were lost in someones inbox.  Potential posts could be submitted as part of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Workflow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;workflow&lt;/a&gt;, where the post is assigned to people for review.  As part of the process email notifications could be sent to each person during the process to let them know of assignment, completion of task and final posting of the content. (One of the cool features of Alfresco is that all content is URL referenceable, so an actual file never needs to be sent to anyone, just the URL.  And the URL always references the latest version of the content.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content transformation.&lt;/strong&gt; Content could also start out in one format and be &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Client_Manage_Content_Rules#Transform_and_copy_content_to_a_specific_space&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;transformed&lt;/a&gt; to another by rule.   It is possible that the post could first start out as a Word document and then be introduced into the repository using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Microsoft_Office&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alfresco Microsoft Office Integration&lt;/a&gt;. Before content makes it to be published, the Word document could be transformed into a text file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfresco makes it possible for you to create collaborative content, in a collaborative way.  With more businesses starting to use blogs to communicate with customers, being able to manage the content is becoming more important.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      I wouldn&amp;#8217;t call Musashi ordinary. But he is. That&amp;#8217;s what&amp;#8217;s extraordinary about him. He&amp;#8217;s not content with relying on whatever natural gifts he may have. Knowing he&amp;#8217;s ordinary, he&amp;#8217;s always trying to improve himself. No one appreciates the agonizing effort he&amp;#8217;s had to make. Now that his years of training have yielded such spectacular results, everybody&amp;#8217;s talking about his &amp;#8216;God-given talent.&amp;#8217; That&amp;#8217;s how men who don&amp;#8217;t try very hard comfort themselves.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
      This is the way for men who want to learn my strategy:
    &lt;/p&gt;
    
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Do not think dishonestly
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        The way is in training
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Become acquainted with every aim
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Know the ways of all profession
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Develop intuitive judgment and understanding for everything
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Perceive those things which cannot be seen
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        Pay attention even to trifles

While I am &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderate&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;moderate&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_American_liberalism&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;liberal&lt;/a&gt; in most of my views, I am for &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_vouchers&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;School&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.choiceineducation.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vouchers&lt;/a&gt;. There are just too many things wrong with the education system. That is why my kids go to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_school&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;charter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reaganacademy.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;school&lt;/a&gt; with a more aggressive &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reaganacademy.org//index.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;curriculum&lt;/a&gt;. My other disappointment was that my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.votepetersen.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neighbor&lt;/a&gt; was unable to unseat any of the sitting &lt;a href=&quot;http://extras.sltrib.com/elections/2007/utah.asp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;incumbents&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springville%2C_Utah&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Springvile&lt;/a&gt; where I live.&lt;br /&gt;
Our discussion turned towards Presidential politics. I like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barackobama.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;. I like the message. I like the presentation. I like the regal view he has of politics and moving it above the partisan mess that is par for the course today. Will he get down and mean as things get tight? Maybe. But I hope not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things that I found interesting last night was that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://exitpoll.byu.edu/Default.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Utah Colleges Exit Poll&lt;/a&gt;, found that in Salt Lake County, both Hillary and Barack polled better than Guilliani and Romney. (That makes me happy, because I am not a fan of either.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started to discuss Obama’s voting record. Voting history/Bill sponsorship is important to me, so I found a couple of links to that information. The last link is to one of my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensecrets.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;favorite sites&lt;/a&gt;, where you can track the money, which is probably even more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your content authors in the Authoring instance of Alfresco, inside your firewall, would create content.  This content would be deployed to a runtime instance of Alfresco outside of your firewall and/or to your IIS servers.  (Publishing to your IIS servers would be deploying static content.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When creating content under &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Web_Content_Management&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alfresco WCM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Forms_Developer_Guide&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;forms&lt;/a&gt; are used to collect/enter the content.  The content is defined in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSD&quot;&gt;XML Scheme Definition&lt;/a&gt; (XSD).  This XSD defines the form  (content model) that the content author uses to enter content.  The XSD is used to create the XML file that holds the content that you are creating.  Applying templates against this XML file you can then create &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Forms_Developer_Guide#Rendering_Engines&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;renditions of the content&lt;/a&gt;.  These templates can be the HTML &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FreeMarker&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Freemarker&lt;/a&gt; templates, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSLT&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;XSLT&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XSL-FO&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;XSL-FO&lt;/a&gt;.  The renditions can be full pages, micro-pages, code snippets or render the content in another format, like creating a PDF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your .NET web application could retrieve/ use content in a couple of ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0/ The Alfresco runtime could be queried via the SOAP APIs. The results displayed in your web application&lt;br /&gt;
1/ URL calls to web scripts, which would &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Web_Scripts_Framework#HTTP_Response_Formats&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; XML (that could be formatted as RSS or ATOM), JSON or rendered HTML (that could be a widget, or html with reference to your wire framework) that could be included directly in the page, or wrapped in an IFRAME.&lt;br /&gt;
2/ Dynamic calls to static content on an IIS server.  (Content can be deployed to a specific location, and your .NET code could display that content in some fashion. [Reading files by naming convention, filetype, etc.])&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same type of implementation can be use with Java/J2EE, PHP, Ruby on Rails, CF, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

I must point out, while it would have been nice to have another girl, another boy suits us just fine. We love spoiling Olivia, and a household of rambunctious boys is just hours of fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.navellieremerging.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Louis Navellier&lt;/a&gt; explains in his book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Little-Book-That-Makes-Rich/dp/047013772X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-1229949-0360455?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1194393403&amp;amp;sr=8-1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book That Makes You Rich: A Proven Market-Beating Formula for Growth Investing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the logical dilemma I faced everyday as Adrienne tried to explain to me that the chances of having a girl increased with each boy we had:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One of the most common emotional mistakes is the “gambler’s fallacy.” That is a tendency to think that when a tossed coin lands on heads five times in a row it is much more likely to land on tails the next time. This supposition is incorrect. The odds of flipping tails on the sixth try are exactly what they were the first five: 50-50. Each flip occurs independently of the others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now have a name for what dumbfounded me for years. Silly woman….I love you still.&lt;/p&gt;

But it raises an interesting question, what are your top five Open Source applications? What are the ones you can’t live without? Which ones provide the important business infrastructure that your business, small or large, can’t live without?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t run a business, but I live in open source (minus my Mac, which is more of a hybrid). So my top five don’t reflect a business point of view, but more of an end user point of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;0/ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firefox.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; – It is how I “see” the world. Firefox is the window/vehicle that gets me from place to place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1/ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openoffice.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;NeoOffice&lt;/a&gt; – While I do have Microsoft Office, I invariably turn to OpenOffice for word processing, spreadsheets, etc. I don’t see why you would want to lock content away in binary formats, that may not be usable in the future. (And yes I am poo-pooing &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OOXML&lt;/a&gt;. Something can be open and still not be open. Can a spec that is 6000 pages long really be open?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2/ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linux.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt; – My preferred distro is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensuse.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt;. For the past two and a half years, Linux was my primary OS. (Even my wife uses Linux on her laptop.) The control, the flexibility, freedom of choice, you name it, Linux has got it in spades. And lets not forget, it is just plain cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3/ &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.menalto.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gallery&lt;/a&gt; – With family and friends spread all over the world, the best medium with which to communicate is the Internet. And pictures are worth a thousand words. We share those special moments with them using Gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4/ &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adiumx.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Adium&lt;/a&gt; – If you have friends, and most likely you do, chances are they are on separate IM networks. Running multiple IM clients is just crazy. For Mac users, Adium is a must. Or for Linux/windows you have &lt;a href=&quot;http://pidgin.im/pidgin/home/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pidgin&lt;/a&gt;. All are running &lt;a href=&quot;http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/WhatIsLibpurple&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;libpurple&lt;/a&gt; on the backend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the ones I use most…..well those and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wentnet.com/projects/xnjb/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;XNJB&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wordpress.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;, and a whole slew of other apps. Oh and by the way can I interest you in a little &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;open source document management&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Alfresco&lt;/a&gt; has just &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com/community/barometer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published a survey taken of our community members on their software usage&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com/community/barometer/osb_0707.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Take a look&lt;/a&gt; at how you stack up against our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alfresco.com/community/register/?source=community&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;growing community&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has become a tradition, not a good one, but a tradition none the less. We go on a family vacation, we go to the ER. I spent almost a week one Christmas, when we visited my parents in Denver, in a hospital with my son Andrew. RSV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have taken kids to the ER in Louisiana for dehydration and high fevers when we visited my in-laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now my daughter Olivia is on her way to the ER here in Southern California, for what appears to be a dislocated wrist. Can you dislocate your wrist?&lt;/p&gt;

He has a world view that, I believe that even most my conservative friends could buy into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is definitely a view I can agree with. The military (aka force) is a powerful tool in diplomacy; To be used as a threat of force and as the means of force.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; It’s not just international do-goodism. To Obama, everything and everyone everywhere is of strategic concern to the United States. “We cannot hope to shape a world where opportunity outweighs danger unless we ensure that every child, everywhere, is taught to build and not to destroy.” The “security of the American people is inextricably linked to the security of all people.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
The world is ever transforming and I believe that the current administration is filled with people who are too slow to react to these changes, or who are mired in old world views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember discussions I had with my classmates @ &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYU&quot;&gt;BYU&lt;/a&gt; about Clinton’s reductions of the military. At the time, it was the appropriate the thing to do. They disagreed. The state of the world supported it. It may support a larger military now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new worlds fight against terrorism supports different type of military.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; …Obama wants to increase defense spending. He wants to add 65,000 troops to the Army and recruit 27,000 more Marines. Why? To fight terrorism. 
&amp;gt; He wants the American military to “stay on the offense, from Djibouti to Kandahar,” and he believes that “the ability to put boots on the ground will be critical in eliminating the shadowy terrorist networks we now face.” He wants to ensure that we continue to have “the strongest, best-equipped military in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really liked what the Marine Corps did in the 90s. They redesigned themselves. (Read “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Making-Corps-Thomas-Ricks/dp/0684848171&quot;&gt;Making the Corps&lt;/a&gt;“) They worked on developing a smaller fighting force, that is trained to get in and get out. A true surgical strike force.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Obama never once says that military force should be used only as a last resort. Rather, he insists that “no president should ever hesitate to use force — unilaterally if necessary,” not only “to protect ourselves . . . when we are attacked,” but also to protect “our vital interests” when they are “imminently threatened.” That’s known as preemptive military action. It won’t reassure those around the world who worry about letting an American president decide what a “vital interest” is and when it is “imminently threatened.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
This goes to the point made earlier in the article, about leading by example. He has the view that the US should be the leader of the world. (I believe this contradicts Kucinich’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://youtube.com/watch?v=-lcg1xQJnow&amp;amp;mode=related&amp;amp;search=&quot;&gt;view&lt;/a&gt; of being equal to, but not above. To an extent he is right, we should work with others to help create solutions to and fix problems of the world. But Obama builds on this, that we should lead by example. For ex. environmental issues. So, China has a larger carbon footprint than we do, and are not doing much to reduce it. Does that mean we shouldn’t do our part?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have become an even more global society in the last 15 or so years. What is vital to the US is often vital to the world (stopping terrorism, reducing greenhouse emissions and dependency on oil, health care, education, etc.) We should lead the world in creating/finding solutions to these problems. We should not continue on in contributing to the problems by saying, “they are still doing it, so why shouldn’t we?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have become even less enamored with all of the Presidential candidates. We have reached “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057883/&quot;&gt;The Best Man&lt;/a&gt;” scenario and maybe worse. We are working from 2nd and 3rd tier contenders. Where are the true leaders, innovators, etc. that we need? Start trying to decide who will do the least amount of damage in the next four years. I am not sure who that will be. I am liking Obama from the D side. But who from the R side will annoy me the least? I am not sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;gt; The bill provides $95.5 billion for operations, mainly in Iraq and Afghanistan — $4 billion more than sought by the president. The legislation also includes $6.9 billion for recovery along the Gulf Coast, compared to $3.4 billion sought by the White House. It allocates $650 million on children’s health programs, $400 million on home heating aid and $500 million on wildfire control. 
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; The measure would also provide $3.5 billion to the nation’s farmers, but the Democratic negotiators dropped other farm aid in the wake of accusations from Mr. Bush and Republicans that the bill had been larded with special interest provisions to attract enough votes for passage. Among the spending eliminated was money for spinach growers, Christmas tree farmers, shrimp fisherman and sugar cane growers.

&lt;p&gt;Please quit trying to confuse people with your rhetoric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to the politicians attaching your pork to this bill…Stop. Keep the bill clean. Let it win or lose straight up and down, on its merits. (It seems somewhat clear (to me at least) that the pork funding is to inflate the bottom line.)&lt;/p&gt;

To continue in that tradition:

&lt;p&gt;To continue in that tradition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two of my kids go to preschool a few days a week. The preschool is located in a complex with several businesses. The access is constrained because of its location. Compound that by the number of people dropping of their kids for school and people coming to work or going to the businesses at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of every “semester”, the school sends home with every child a diagram of how the parents should drive in and out and where to park when dropping off or picking up their children. But inevitably there is a handful of parents who do not heed the directions. This is really a problem because the ways in and out are pretty much a one way road, with room for only one car. So most of us are stuck on busy roads waiting for the morons, who are too good to follow directions, to get out of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as bad as waiting for them to clear out of the entrances and exits are when they park against a wall that is directly behind the parking spots. When they park against the wall, they reduce drastically the amount of room those of us who actually can follow directions have to exit the parking spots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for this post my thing that must go, are people who can’t follow directions that are written to make their lives easier and safer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a wonder that kids today don’t want to follow directions when their parents won’t even follow them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first it was kind of funny. Now it is just scary. It makes me think of the recent news story (can’t find the link right now) that talked about limiting advertisements or banning advertisements on websites related to kids tv shows or something. I learned from the article that there are limits on the number and length of advertisements associated with programming focused at children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand the need for the limits now. It can be very trying to reason (You ask “why are you trying to reason with a child?” Well because I think that they can understand sound logic.) with my kids over every toy or every food they want to buy. ( I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/118/6/2563&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; from the journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/&quot;&gt;Pediatrics&lt;/a&gt;, which should make for fascinating reading on the topic.)&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:arial&quot;&gt;I thought I’d check out a few other sites. While SLED was not number one, or even in the top ten, several sites had either &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novell.com/products/server/&quot;&gt;SLES&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensuse.org&quot;&gt;openSUSE&lt;/a&gt; in their top 10 (most often it was openSUSE). If you removed the pirated software from the lists, we typically came out number one or two.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  Which brings up the age old discussion of when companies start touting number of downloads, how accurate can these numbers really be? For open source software, torrents are legitimate sources of distribution. (Well, any form of p2p distribution is for that matter.) And it maybe more telling, in that this is people (ie users) sharing something with others. They see value in the product, because a/ they continue to seed and b/ there is obviously demand. Otherwise, why continue to share? Why continue to use the bandwidth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial&quot;&gt;When we moved in, we put Molly outside again. She had been stuck inside our apartment for nearly 7 months. (Molly &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; our 2 year old Labrador/Pitbull mix.) She was extremely happy to be out again. Because we had no fence yet, we put her on a stake with a 20 foot cord to allow her to run. The length allowed her to move, within our property, with a good deal of freedom, but stopped her from roaming the neighborhood, or running away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial&quot;&gt;Apparently, it also put her too close to the sidewalk. Now understand, there is construction going on all around us. So the sidewalks are covered with mounds of dirt, rock, construction materials and vehicles. So no one in the their right mind would be walking on the sidewalks. But someone thought that she was too close to the sidewalk anyway. They anonymously called the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springville,_Utah&quot;&gt;Springville&lt;/a&gt; Police Department. They dispatched one of the city’s animal control officers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;font-family: arial&quot;&gt;
  The officer first noticed that Molly violated some city ordinance that she was to close to the sidewalk. OK, so let us know and we will move her. Next, the officer took note that she looked to thin and wanted to fine us $300 for abuse. Well, she was recovering from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/Top/Health/Animal/Conditions_and_Diseases/Pancreatic_Disorders/&quot;&gt;Pancreatitis&lt;/a&gt;. And had lost a great deal of weight. (She was treated by a veterinarian, with paper work to prove it.) They agreed to dismiss that charge. But finally, they said that she was some part &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pit_bull&quot;&gt;pitbull&lt;/a&gt;. Which apparently the city has outlawed. (Searching the city&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springville.org&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, I was unable to find anything to indicate that you could not own a pitbull. [UPDATE: Apparently, the city&apos;s search engine does not index PDFs....how lame. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springville.org/municipalcode/Title_3.pdf&quot;&gt;Ordinance 3-7-116&lt;/a&gt;])
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial&quot;&gt;We were not home when they first came by to look at her. They told Adrienne (I was at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novell.com/brainshare/&quot;&gt;Brainshare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial&quot;&gt; when this all occurred) that Molly was an extremely vicious dog. Um, OK. You mean the dog that has grown up around our kids (Ages 5 to 1). The one that would sleep in the same bed as my kids while we lived in the apartment. The one that my two year old daughter would ride around on like a horse. And lay on the floor and cuddle with. The one that would let my one year old son crawl all over her. Yeah…sure…she is vicious. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial&quot;&gt;Adrienne, asked how the officer could tell she was part pitbull, to which the animal control officer responded, “She has white paws.” Yes, crawl back in your seat since you fell out of it because that dog siting next to you, which you know is not a pitbull has white paws. I began to wonder what kind of people had the city hired to do animal control. Exactly what are their credentials? Oh, yeah, they might have high school diplomas and they gave them a badge and now they are experts.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial&quot;&gt;They left a copy of the city ordinance with us. And agreed to let Molly stay until, I had a chance to say goodbye. So the next morning the city arrived to take her away. We had the kids all come out and say goodbye, just to prove how gentle she was with them. Molly knew something was up as I lead her to the kennel on the officers truck. We asked about the ordinance (Springville is the only city in all of Utah, County that has a ban against pitbulls.) He explained that the city had enacted the ordinance because of a single attack. Not because there had been several attacks. All on the national hysteria and a single attack moved them to ban the breed.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial&quot;&gt;Now the city does provide a way to have a pitbull if you want. First you make an application to the city ($50). Then, if approved (The city has approved only two pitbulls, and the animal control officers had already guaranteed us that Molly would not be approved because they believed her to be vicious.) you can pay a yearly license fee of $100 (per dog, limit two. Other breeds pay $15 per dog, also limit of two.). You must also get an additional &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/west/2005/07/25/57575.htm&quot;&gt;$50,000 dollars of insurance&lt;/a&gt;. These requirements and the officer’s already stated opposition to Molly, lead us to the tough decision of needing to let her go. After they took her, we thought about trying to fight this, but decided that loosing Molly again would be to traumatic of an experience to try.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial&quot;&gt;The kids often talk of Molly. Taylor drew a picture of her today at school. I asked why and he said because he missed her. Olivia has named one of her stuffed dogs Molly, and sometimes asks to go out and see “Her Molly”. We will all miss her. She was a good dog and friend. So if you have a pitbull, don’t think about moving to Springville, Utah. We thought it would be a nice place for our family (which we considered Molly apart of), it has thus far proved to be not that great. Maybe it will be so in the end. But I know that at least it will be a good place to teach the kids about bad laws.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Taylor and Andrew had their first game of the season this evening. What an improvement 6 months of growing up made. They both were more involved with the game. Andrew had an assist for a goal. Taylor made some good defensive plays. After Andrew’s assist, their coach went to give him a high five and Andrew went for a hug. Taylor didn’t think that he was doing well, but I explained to him that sometimes it is better to turn the ball over by kicking it out than to give the other team an easy opportunity to score. That made since to him and the light went off that he did play well stopping several opportunities for quick goals by the other team.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&amp;gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  Andrew had some of his funny moments. He started the game by ripping grass from the field and showering it down over his head. I know everyone has their pre-game rituals. Andrew&amp;#8217;s is to become one with the field. He also has a tendency to run looking down at the ground (Funny that seems to be a habit I had when I started to play basketball in junior high.). At one point in the first half, the other team had the ball near the baseline and kicked the ball out for a goal kick. Andrew not looking up to see that play had stopped, or where he was, ran straight into the goal post with a nice thunk! Luckily he wasn&amp;#8217;t running to fast. He just turned around and ran back down the field.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;font-size:100%&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thers is space for people to call their own and to be alone. I finally have a small part that I can call my own, with a home office. (Part of the deal to get a new house.) I have my books (Adrienne did not ever want to put up my Political Science or Computer books with her Shakespeare and Charlotte Brontë. ), computers and stuff now close to me and accessible for use.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;

    &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: arial;font-size:100%&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I can also call part of the family room mine too. Let&amp;#8217;s just say it was a good birthday! &lt;p&gt;

            &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:100%&quot;&gt;One of the hard parts has been getting everything in place. Adrienne&amp;#8217;s brother and his family were coming two weeks after we first got in (So, yes, they are here now.) Adrienne, being Adrienne, wanted everything in place before they arrived. That added just a little bit more stress to the wanting to get things in place and put away. We didn&amp;#8217;t get everything done (we are still missing some blinds for the back windows downstairs), but enough to make her happy. I guess I should enjoy it before she starts to get antsy about the landscaping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

I said, “There is a cable box sitting at the corner of our lot and you can’t run it from there to our house?” Nope. Grrrr! So we have moved to a wireless provider. (I refuse to use DSL.)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
  The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.digis.net/&quot;&gt;provider&lt;/a&gt; has excellent connectivity and a decent speed. But they don’t give static/routable addresses unless I fork over another 40 dollars. (40 because, I could get an address for 20 more, but at a lower speed.) Well that ain’t gonna happen.
&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  So I have moved the blog to blogger and the gallery to picasaweb. Both have the same URLs. Adrienne&amp;#8217;s blog is down until she wants to put it back up. There is always her gross myspace account&amp;#8230;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
  When circumstances change I&amp;#8217;ll bring everything back up at home. Until then I&amp;#8217;ll just have to live with this.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are some today who feel the same and are making effort to enable the inquiry of the curios to the learned possible in their desire to expand their understanding of the world in which we live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, like those I have pointed in its direction, have not always had the means (time and money) to commit to a degree or certificate course in the pursuit of “higher” education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Yes, I do have a degree [&lt;a href=&quot;http://fhss.byu.edu/polsci/index.htm&quot;&gt;Political Science&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&quot;http://philosophy.byu.edu/index.html&quot;&gt;Philosophy&lt;/a&gt;].

[Adrienne first was working towards an additional degree in Nursing at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uvsc.edu/&quot; title=&quot;Utah Valley State College&quot;&gt;UVSC&lt;/a&gt;. Then paused to get certified as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certified_Nursing_Assistant&quot; title=&quot;Certified Nursing Assistant&quot;&gt;CNA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Care_Technician&quot; title=&quot;Patient Care Technician&quot;&gt;PCT&lt;/a&gt;. After working for several months at &lt;a href=&quot;http://intermountainhealthcare.org/xp/public/americanfork/&quot; title=&quot;American Fork Hospital&quot;&gt;American Fork Hospital&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://intermountainhealthcare.org/xp/public/americanfork/services/womenchildrens/birthingcenter.xml&quot;&gt;Mother/Baby Unit&lt;/a&gt;, she decided that it was not really want she wanted and is now working at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.springville.org/&quot; title=&quot;Springville, Utah&quot;&gt;Springville&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youseemore.com/Springville/&quot; title=&quot;Springville Public Library&quot;&gt;Library&lt;/a&gt;. She will start, in the next year or so, pursuing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Library_and_Information_Science&quot;&gt;Masters in Library Science&lt;/a&gt;.] I have always felt, that in this partnership (read marriage), her education is as important, and at times, more important than pursuing advances in mine, as she is/has been the one who has spent the most time at home with our children. (I credit her for providing the home environment that has spawned and developed are kids bases and love of learning.))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Internet has always provided a lot of resources for self education, but the courses provided by MIT, Yale, Berkeley, etc. provided it in an organized, traceable (You can measure your progress) manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Matt points out, the Universities will not loose money by providing this content. Could they monetize it? Sure. But how what/who does that help? It will not get people in the seats (physical or virtualized) of the classes. Have these experts wasted time in learning these things to give them away? No. Access to them (Where I think the real value in higher education is) is still limited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kind of like why you &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;go&lt;/span&gt; to the doctor. You could diagnose yourself by searching symptoms online or in a book. But going to the expert is much easier because he/she has specialized knowledge/training that can be applied to your specific case [patient history, environmental conditions etc.] (Kind of like access to those open source support engineers (who have the knowledge to help your customers) or direct access to the software engineers who write and share that code.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These online libraries can only help to increase the general knowledge and make available to the masses a good that they could get from any provider of that good. There by creating a baseline of where the real differentiator in what the actual value is. That real value is in access to those that can help you when you have questions, concerns or problems and provide you with answers specific to your needs. That is the value add of purchasing support for the opens source software that you use. Or enrolling in a class at one of these Universities. Access to the experts in the product that you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;

(More on why we are in an apartment later.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We go out to see what they are doing and to put them back to bed.  (We had already put them to bed at least a dozen times.) It wasn’t surprising that they were still awake, as they had eaten ice cream cake a couple hours before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taylor was sitting on the couch with his pillow, blankets and a &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Cartoon Network&apos;s Ben 10&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/ben10/index.html&quot;&gt;Ben 10&lt;/a&gt; figure.  Andrew was standing at the kitchen table with more ice cream and proclaims, with a look of innocence, “‘Cause I’m sick”.  Cameron was eating grapes and had two new black eyes, thanks to Taylor.  Olivia was drinking a glass of milk, as was Molly.  Olivia had once again poured milk in Molly’s water dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olivia turns to us and says “mmm, yum!”  We burst out laughing, not only for the comment, but because she is wearing one of the boys t-shirts and Taylor’s swim shorts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrienne then comments, “They must be so confused, why they’re not getting in trouble.”  To which Olivia responded, “I’m so confused.” Which resulted in more laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is never a dull minute in our lives with 5 kids, 5 and under.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of you may be wondering where Sawyer was through all of this…asleep. At least we have one obedient child, even if he is only 11 months old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a Holiday Inn ad, that aired only once. One of the reasons it has stuck with me for so long was because it was so progressive for the time. It still makes me laugh today.&lt;/p&gt;

Adrienne’s Mom had been here to help out before. It was a real help. It made it possible for me to keep working with little down time. And made Adrienne’s life a lot easier. She had an emergency c-section. Quite a scary event. She went in for a regular checkup and the nurse midwife told her not to move. She asked why only to be told that the nurse had the babies feet in her hands. They did not want to risk anything. Her placenta had detached and had ruptured. Luckily, her OB has his office at a hospital. Things worked out great. Baby and Mom were OK. Mom came away with a 12-inch incision and a renewed out look on life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now to the weekend….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday I spent the evening working on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/?p=95&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; site going through the error log. When you change blog software, you have a lot of links that no longer match up to what search engines, aggregators, and bookmarks match any longer. So spent time creating &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_alias.html#redirect&quot;&gt;redirects&lt;/a&gt; for archives, RSS feeds, resume, and misc. files. It is really interesting to see what people are looking for and can’t find.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    Saturday we took the kids to get Easter pictures taken. &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://gallery.ottleys.net/gallery/v/taylor/&quot;&gt;Taylor&lt;/a&gt; did not want to cooperate on the way there and &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://gallery.ottleys.net/gallery/v/olivia/&quot;&gt;Olivia&lt;/a&gt; didn&amp;#8217;t want to get her picture taken once there. Taylor had an all around bad day. After pictures Adrienne and I headed off to Home Depot for some tools and gardening supplies. Mom stayed with the boys. Taylor did not like the fact that he was going to have to wait to ride in the jeep. So he ran away. And far. Down the street and around the corner and almost to 1600 North. A rather busy street. Luckily, sense kicked in and he turned around.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    We spent the afternoon pulling out the new patio furniture and grill. Putting in an updated flower box in the front (new design). It started getting late, so we grilled steaks, and enjoyed the cool evening air.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Sunday, was a lazy day. Church in the morning. Relax in the afternoon. In the evening we had a over my siblings, living in Utah, for dessert. I have to admit that I really kind of enjoyed it. Normally, I would have been miserable the entire time. Maybe I am growing up&amp;#8230;.a bit.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    The highlight of the evening was the boys, and their cousin Jamie, running around the backyard with light saber. I have video which I want to edit and put music to. There are also a handful of pictures. Mom has a bunch which she will send when she gets back home from California.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Today was so so. With the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.redhat.com/about/news/prarchive/2006/jboss.html&quot;&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; the Red Hat was acquiring JBoss.

Spent sometime catching up on the teams current defects and planning for the rest of the week. It was a short day since I needed to take Mom to the airport.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    When we got home, I fertilized the lawn and added new runs for the &amp;#8220;invisible&amp;#8221; fence for Molly. Worked on training her that it is better to avoid the shock than to risk a bit of pain to get out only to be put back in the dog run.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I think I will go and walk the dog before doing some reading and going to bed. Late night TV will be less enjoyable now that the BBC Series &amp;#8220;&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/myfamily/&quot;&gt;My Family&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; has had its season finale.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Oh, in other news, my sister Beth&amp;#8217;s water broke. She should be having a baby in the next 24 hrs.
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Entered a couple defects on the process, they are probably based more on my inexperience with this process, than anything actually being wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
For the last week I have been trying to work on being more effective with my time. It seems like I can accomplish a lot, but don’t seem to be spending my time very wisely. Read parts of the series “&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;How I Work&quot; href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/03/20/8371781/index.htm&quot;&gt;How I Work&lt;/a&gt;“. I first came across the series when I read &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Bill Gates&quot; href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/30/news/newsmakers/gates_howiwork_fortune/index.htm&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; by Bill Gates. It is by far more useful than the others in the series. One common thread across them all was, that they started their days early (typically between 5 and 6). Hmmm, the question now is can I be discipled enough to continuously wake up that early?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight was bath night. And someone was a little too excited about it.&lt;/p&gt;

New look, new software.  After using MT for so long I decided it was time for a change.  WordPress just happens to be more along the lines of what I want, better plugins, easier to use, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for something else…While watching General Conference and taking somenotes, I wanted to be able to look up really quickly a scripture using a Mozilla search plugin.  However, when I found one, it was broken.  It seems that when it was written, the &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;http://scriptures.lds.org&quot; href=&quot;http://scriptures.lds.org&quot;&gt;LDS scriptures&lt;/a&gt; site used a different search url.  Oh well, time to dig in and figure out how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is actually rather &lt;a href=&quot;http://mycroft.mozdev.org/deepdocs/deepdocs.html&quot; title=&quot;http://mycroft.mozdev.org/deepdocs/deepdocs.html&quot;&gt;simple&lt;/a&gt;. After a bit of hacking, I have updated the original plugin written by Marlo Bell.  It should work on any browser that supports Apple’s Sherlock standard.  I have not tested on anything beyond Firefox. If you encounter a problem, please let me know and we will work out a solution.&lt;br /&gt;

They are loosing viewership due to the increased use of the Internet as a provider of entertainment. They are loosing people to the general availability of on-demand entertainment. Well count one more lose. My son Taylor has become one of those loses. He loves the ready availability of entertainment/education on Internet. His favorite sites? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbskids.org&quot;&gt;www.pbskids.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.transformers.com&quot;&gt;www.transformers.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starwars.com&quot;&gt;www.starwars.com&lt;/a&gt;. He can then link through those sites to others, were he can watch streaming video of his favorite shows. (One of the local channels had the Transformers (and others) cartoon on in the afternoon, but choose to cancel it to show reruns of ER. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wb30tv.com/&quot;&gt;Idiots&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cartoon comes in three separate parts. And he puts up with advertising on the site and in the streams. He is the future of a new kind of television viewer. Right now, Tivo and its competition are fine for this. By the real future of TV (and I think that some &lt;a href=&quot;http://comcast.m0.net/m/p/com/mic/index.asp&quot;&gt;cable providers&lt;/a&gt; and maybe some others are doing something like this) is a complete on demand schedule where the viewer can choose there own schedule of shows delivered to them from the provider with no need for a set-top box or media center style PC. I watch I want to watch, when I want to watch. No channel flipping, no searching for something to watch in the middle of the night. [The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.comcast.com&quot;&gt;Comcast&lt;/a&gt; comes very close to this…the first problem that I see, is that shows are available during a certain period of time..from day x to day y. True on demand when be available all the time.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of shows that Adrienne and I like to watch that air at the same time. We haven’t moved to Tivo yet, so we have to record one while we watch the other. Sometimes there is a special or something else going on that also conflicts with these shows and we are stuck trying to decide which shows are more “important” to us. (Sometimes if we forget to record a show or miss it completely, I will try to grab a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent&quot;&gt;torrent&lt;/a&gt; of the show…which is very useful.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I have to do that? No. I should be able to design my own broadcast schedule from the multitude of networks, to watch when I want to watch. And I would even sit through commercials if I could get that. True on-demand TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And of course, why am I stuck watching on a TV…any device, any where. Once again, torrents are great. &lt;img src=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif&quot; alt=&quot;;)&quot; class=&quot;wp-smiley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Well, I attached the patch to Novell’s bugzilla where I had filled the bug.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My laptop does not report back the rate the battery is being depleted correctly. The Gnome-Applet, Battery Charge Monitor, reports in a mouse over that the time remaining is unknown. However, when the low battery warning comes up, it says that there are -1 minutes of battery remaining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is how B-C-M does its calculations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From acpi-linux.c&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;407   remain += read_long (hash, “remaining capacity”);&lt;br /&gt;
408   rate += read_long (hash, “present rate”);&lt;br /&gt;
409   g_hash_table_destroy (hash); &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Line 408 reads the present rate from /proc/acpi/battery/BAT1/state. (BAT1 is my battery.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present rate of discharge for my battery is always 0 mA. Which is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little farther down in the same file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;422   if (rate &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !charging)&lt;br /&gt;
423     apminfo-&amp;gt;battery_time = (int) (remain/(float)rate * 60);&lt;br /&gt;
424   else if (rate &amp;amp;&amp;amp; charging)&lt;br /&gt;
425     apminfo-&amp;gt;battery_time = (int) ((acpiinfo-&amp;gt;max_capacity-remain)/(float)rate * 60);&lt;br /&gt;
426   else&lt;br /&gt;
427     apminfo-&amp;gt;battery_time = -1;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my rate is always 0…..I fallout at the end: battery_time = -1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From battstat_applet.c&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;514   remaining = g_strdup_printf( ngettext(&lt;br /&gt;
515        ”You have %d minute of battery power “&lt;br /&gt;
516        ”remaining (%d%% of the total capacity).”,&lt;br /&gt;
517        ”You have %d minutes of battery power “&lt;br /&gt;
518        ”remaining (%d%% of the total capacity).”,&lt;br /&gt;
519        info-&amp;gt;minutes ),&lt;br /&gt;
520        info-&amp;gt;minutes,info-&amp;gt;percent );&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above prints part (The offending part) of the text that prints in the low battery warning. info is the apminfo structure. So info-&amp;gt;minutes for me is always -1. How to fix?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple if statement around the above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;514   if( info-&amp;gt;minutes &amp;gt;= 0 )&lt;br /&gt;
515     remaining = g_strdup_printf( ngettext(&lt;br /&gt;
516        ”You have %d minute of battery power “&lt;br /&gt;
517        ”remaining (%d%% of the total capacity).”,&lt;br /&gt;
518        ”You have %d minutes of battery power “&lt;br /&gt;
519        ”remaining (%d%% of the total capacity).”,&lt;br /&gt;
520        info-&amp;gt;minutes ),&lt;br /&gt;
521        info-&amp;gt;minutes,info-&amp;gt;percent );&lt;br /&gt;
522   else&lt;br /&gt;
523        remaining = g_strdup_printf( “You have unknown minutes of battery power “&lt;br /&gt;
524        ”remaining (%d%% of the total capacity).”,&lt;br /&gt;
525        info-&amp;gt;percent );&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I get the else…I am not too sure of the language. But I wanted to keep it similar to what is currently working other places. Now I think I am suppose to submit it to the mailing list…..?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up late…second week in a row. I need to start setting the alarm. Worked out ok. Olivia was congested. So Adrienne stayed home from church with her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have started to spend sometime going through old code from past projects. I want to clean it up and post it on the site. Who knows, someone may find it useful. I think that for the most part it all comes from my work at the courts. I just pull out the useful snippets and classes. (It is all java for now.) I’ll limit it to my work, as I have source that a couple of different people worked on / wrote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ho hum…why won’t the boys go to sleep!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I was up late migrating my web server to a new machine. Saying good-bye to the 233GHz machine and moving up to a 450GHz box. Blazing speeds! The main reason for the move was memory. The old server had around 192Mb of memory and even with making it bare bones (tuning,etc) it still was a bit sluggish with the newest Gallery2 software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan was to move up to about 750MB on the new box, but the memory, while “recognized” by the BIOS, would cause a kernel panic when I tried to install SUSE Linux 10.0. Hmmmm. I didn’t have much time to investigate…or desire. So I tried some other memory I had on hand and so now we are blazing along with 384MB. Which has made a world of difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving the data was fairly easy too. I exported and re-imported the database. The websites themselves were on a separate harddrive/partition. So I was able to just move the harddrive from server a to server b. A quick couple of clicks (can you say click when you are talking about ncurses?) in YaST and it was ready. (I know that I could have simply update the fstab file….but YaST is there for a reason right!?) A couple of quick modifications to the Apache2 conf files. Copy over the vhosts files from the old server. Done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick nessus scan to make sure that I hadn’t forgotten any of my other hardening steps. Voila!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I made a couple of tweaks to the running services, etc. just to remove a couple of unneeded things to free up some more memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I the next couple of days I want tune Apache some more. I may just have to try out a couple of new things on the server now.&lt;/p&gt;

I can’t say that I would want to be in my bosses shoes either. He has been visibly drained emotionally for several weeks. I have to say that my boss is a good man. He fought for us everyday. Right now I wouldn’t want to work for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

So last night we donated the car to the Utah branch of the National MS Society. We had donated my previous car, an ’85 Accord, to Veterans of America. Sometimes it isn’t even worth it to try and trade the vehicle in. They are more valuable to these other organizations than to a dealership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have replaced the Saturn with a 2001 Chevy Malibu. 65000 miles. Excellent condition. I think that Adrienne has decided that she will drive it, instead of the Suburban, to school at night to save on gas. She test drove it when I got home from work. She said she didn’t like it. It was too low to the ground. It has been a while since she has driven a car. She has been driving a mini-van since right after Andrew got out of the hospital. (He spent the first six weeks of his life in two different hospitals.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The car only has to get me the 12 miles from home to work and back. This car should work out just fine. (The drive from house to work in New Orleans was 33 miles. This is much nicer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taylor had a fever last night and then started this horrible cough. They say that he has Croup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Olivia and Taylor are both on medication. Now, it is just question of when Cameron and Andrew will catch it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was happy to see Andrew has a friend at school. When I dropped him off this morning, he did the freeze thing again just inside the door. This time he pulled his school bag up in front of his face. Another little boy in the class saw him and yelled out, “Andrew O.!” (There are two Andrews in the class, Andrew O. and Andrew P.) He ran up to Andrew and lifted up the bottom of the bag. They both stood with the bag above their heads facing each other and started to talk. You always worry how your kids are going to do socially in school. It is always reassuring to see when they have friends…and aren’t as big a “loser” as you were in school.&lt;/p&gt;

(The first day of school Taylor just walked right in to class. No good-byes. No hugs. No tears.) Andrew has been very excited about going to school for sometime. And he is pretty willing to go to class. But once he walks through the door… he takes three steps in, stops cold and then proceeds to either hide is face in his hands or pull the hood of his sweatshirt over his face.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually drop him off first, walk Taylor to class and then return to check on Andrew…still in the same spot, as if frozen in time. This past Friday, he was thrown for a loop when he walked into his classroom to find a substitute teacher. Luckily it was Taylor’s teacher from last year. That helped raise his comfort level…a little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, we were running a bit late. As we entered the school, Andrew saw his teacher at the door. He ran into his classroom. I thought, “Yes! It looks like things are changing.” I walked Taylor over to his class and then headed back over to Andrew’s to see how he was doing. And just like Lot’s wife, frozen three steps in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought he had made a leap forward, but it was more like baby steps. It will just be one day at a time for him.&lt;/p&gt;

Administration, configuration, plugin architecture, etc. What I miss and hope that someone gets working soon is RSS. It wasn’t perfect in version 1, but it did make knowing when my wife updated the gallery a bit easier. If I had the time I would try to learn some php to help with the existing working being done on adding this feature.&lt;/p&gt;

How could one clone be different from another clone…aren’t they the same? Watching it this time, and doing some thinking…(Yes, I know that is hard in and of itself for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.utdemocrats.org/&quot;&gt;challenged people&lt;/a&gt; like me.) Clones could be different from each other. While they do resemble each other and have the same physical weaknesses and strengths, they will not have the same experiences and therefore will develop differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say, for example, that I have two clones of me. For some amount of time they are in the same location with me. We are with each other constantly. I then take and place them on opposite sides of the US from each other for another amount of time. At some point we come back together. We are given some sort of challenge. I believe that we would each approach this challenge differently. We would apply our different experiences, knowledge, skills, and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we we appear genetically, physically, to be the same, we would be different people. This in someways bolsters my believe that cloning would be OK (ie ethical)…I have yet to reconcile some of my religious beliefs with cloning….that may be because the church has taken no position on it…that I know of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like what is said &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.libertypages.com/clark/10142.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I usually try to avoid discussing this with other Mormons….they seem to be less open to the possibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The religious issues arise when you start talking about the soul. You believe in it or you don’t. I do. Thus, when you do believe in the soul, you complicate the issue. Is a soul unique to an individual? When does the soul enter the body? Can the body exist without the soul? And a whole host of others…That’s why I avoid discussing it. We complicate the debate with religious passion…which is both good and bad.&lt;/p&gt;

Taylor had seen at least one of them (I think episode 2) on TV sometime back. He has seen the marketing, toys, games, etc. So we thought it might be fun to see them…all. So we rented the first two online through Blockbuster. We saw the third at the dollar theater. We then got episodes four and six from blockbuster (online) and five from a brick and mortar blockbuster. Let’s just say Taylor cried when Darth Vader/Anakin died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we have a monster. Taylor is now an avid Star Wars fan. In his own words, “I am crazy about Star Wars!” He talks about it non stop. The other day we went to a toy store. When we got to the Star Wars section Taylor began to tell us which movies the characters were in. He described the scenes where some of the minor characters appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents have a Star Wars picture &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0789434814/&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt;. When we last visited them in Colorado, Taylor spent a good deal of time looking at that book. He decided that since he didn’t have one he would make one. He now has a notebook full of characters from the Star Wars movies, the Clone Wars cartoons, even the Ewok movies. He has also introduced new characters, with names that he thought up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 4, he has decided that he wants to be a Star Wars artist. He is well on his way to greatness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;================================&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Taylor recognizes that the Jedi are the good guys, he says he would prefer to be a Sith Lord like Darth Vader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are there two release files? Simple. Let’s say you are developing an application that you only want, or only will support on OES, but not on SLES 9 (the base OS behind OES). Voila. There is your control…if you are delivering the application through Open Carpet.&lt;/p&gt;

Some water is making its way through the roof into the dome. (“Like in a sprinkling rain.” he just said.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, when they used the dome as a shelter, it became a disaster. They had people breaking into offices stealing things, they had people destroying furnishings. (“Now it is like a thunderstorm, just in this one area in the dome.”) So when they allowed people into the dome this time, they had the National Guard “policing” the people. They asked the people to bring about 5 days worth of food, most people brought none. (The dome is classified as a refugee not a shelter.) Watch for problems there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: There is a 3′ x 5′ hole in the Superdome roof. The pumps will be out until the rain stops. There is water coming in on the second floor of the Beau Rivage Casino on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. There are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;unconfirmed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; reports of 7 feet of water in Jefferson Parish (New Orleans Metro Area) and&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;unconfirmed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;reports of water coming over the walls of the industrial canal which passes through New Orleans. Right now the brunt of the storm is being felt in Slidell, LA where my in-laws live and where I lived for close to twenty years. I really hope that things are going to be ok for them.&lt;/p&gt;

President W, that tax relief should be at the pump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watching this is kind of crazy. It hasn’t even been a year since we moved away. They just said that that the pumps in the city have failed. This is really not good. The pumps in the city are the real protector of the city from flooding….they aren’t really even that good. (At one point they could remove about an inch an hour…it isn’t unheard of to have more than an inch an hour. Average rain a year is around 60 inches.) The city, being below sea level, needs the pumps to move the water out of the “bowl” that the city of New Orleans is in. The levees that surround city, at their peak, are about at sea level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Family has moved up to Jackson (It will be a Cat 2 storm when the eye reaches there.) and Corinth, Mississippi and also to New Roads, Louisiana. Our prayers go out to family and friends that are being affected by this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;=============&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the nation…Hope that things aren’t going to be really bad in New Orleans…about 70% of the oil in the US moves through New Orleans. Gas Prices are only going to be going up if the damage is extreme…It already is at $70 a barrel. This is bad for everyone. Hey W, what are you going to do to help us all out. You gave the energy companies some tax relief, how about the rest of us now. Why not suspend the tax on oil during this crisis? That would be some immediate short term relief.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like that is going to happen….yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, just my high level overview, not knowing a lot of the internals of either, I’m thinking this shouldn’t be to hard. You are probably just pointing jabber at the ldap server of hula..right? And then work out pulling or adding to the contact list into the users address book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then let’s move it a step further and look at adding to this a client. Now, I know there are lots of IM clients out there, multi-protocol and such, but lets think of this in terms of collaboration via Hula. So we develop a mono based client, with a plug-in architecture. We need to take advantage of the xml routing as Miguel de Icaza pointed &lt;a href=&quot;http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2005/Aug-24.html&quot;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt;. So we build plug-ins that support pulling calendar information from Hula (personnel and shared), a plug-in that supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifolder.com/&quot;&gt;iFolder3&lt;/a&gt; (more integration with the identity store and user address book of Hula), and a plugin that supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://beaglewiki.org/&quot;&gt;Beagle&lt;/a&gt; searches from the client. (You would also want some standard plug-ins that support things like weather and such.) &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jawaad.net&quot;&gt;Jawaad&lt;/a&gt; pointed out to me that this may be doing a lot of the work the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nat.org/dashboard/&quot;&gt;Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; is going to do. Maybe, but if designed right it could be made to be another backend that could be consumed by Dashboard. He also suggested maybe working out a new mono based version of &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaim.sourceforge.net&quot;&gt;gaim&lt;/a&gt; that would support all this…maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So once that was all done, then work could be done on adding the idea of presence awareness to Hula…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is mostly just pondering on an idea….or the blabbering on lunatic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think mostly the later.&lt;/p&gt;

It is a nice, small (10,000 sq ft) exhibit. It appears that this is mostly a fundraiser and market research. They want to know if it is, or will be, worth it to open an aquarium in Utah. I take it they don’t want to run into the problems that the Denver aquarium – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.downtownaquariumdenver.com&quot;&gt;the former, Ocean Journey&lt;/a&gt; – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/business/article/0,1299,DRMN_4_3925290,00.html&quot;&gt;did&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming to Utah from a city that had a very nice &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.auduboninstitute.org/aoa/index.php&quot;&gt;aquarium&lt;/a&gt;, that we went to at least 4 times a year, it will be nice to have the aquarium here. Now we just need to take a look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hoglezoo.org/&quot;&gt;zoo&lt;/a&gt;. It is not the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.auduboninstitute.org/zoo/index.php&quot;&gt;Audubon zoo&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a zoo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say what you will about Utah being more kid friendly than New Orleans, but they just can’t cut it when it comes to something like what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.auduboninstitute.org/&quot;&gt;Audubon Nature Institute&lt;/a&gt; has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of pointing them all to the different repositories and other sources to get them, we set up a shared directory through which people would just grab them and updated them as needed. Knowing that this was probably not the most efficient way to do this, and seeing how the person assigned to set up a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novell.com/products/zenworks/linuxmanagement/&quot;&gt;ZLM server&lt;/a&gt; for the team to use failed at this miserably (he got a another machine for himself which was a plus for him I guess. But it has been almost a year and still no ZLM server!). To not step on any toes, and not needing all the functionality of a zlm server, I set up an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.open-carpet.org/&quot;&gt;open carpet server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as I let people know it was up, they come asking to use it. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novell.com/products/openenterpriseserver/index.html?sourceidint=productsmenu_oes&quot;&gt;OES Netware&lt;/a&gt; has the ability to use red-carpet (the rug command line tool) to update rpms. (Anybody out there building rpms for Netware?) So to get this working for OES Netware you need to add it as a distribution in the distribution.xml file. Quite easy to do, just add:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;distro&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;OES&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;NW65&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;i386&amp;lt;/arch&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;rpm&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;target&amp;gt;oes-nw65-i386&amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;status&amp;gt;supported&amp;lt;/status&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;detect&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;file source=&quot;/etc/netware-release&quot; substring=&quot;OES NW65&quot; /&amp;gt;
 	&amp;lt;/detect&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/distro&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will get you up and running. While OES Linux is based on the the same code as SLES 9. You should probably add something like the following to use open-carpet with it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;distro&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;name&amp;gt;Novell Open Enterprise Server Linux&amp;lt;/name&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;version&amp;gt;9&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;arch&amp;gt;i586&amp;lt;/arch&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;type&amp;gt;rpm&amp;lt;/type&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;target&amp;gt;oes-linux-i586&amp;lt;/target&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;status&amp;gt;supported&amp;lt;/status&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;detect&amp;gt;
		&amp;lt;file source=&quot;/etc/novell-release&quot; substring=&quot;Novell Open Enterprise Server Linux&quot; /&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;/detect&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/distro&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will probably end up setting up a ZLM server any way as I have not discovered how to use open carpet to deliver patches from a YOU (YaST Online Update) server yet. (Which is what we are spending a lot of time testing right now.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She took Cameron and Olivia to the doctor yesterday. I went down to the University Bookstore to return one textbook for her and get another. It appears that the professor for her biology class switched texts from what the bookstore had listed. So they didn’t have enough. Adrienne looked at buying it online at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.half.com&quot;&gt;half.com&lt;/a&gt;. But it looks like it would just be easier for her to wait for the new text to come in on Friday and pick it up on Saturday. She has assignments due on Monday so it should be a fun weekend for all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took Taylor and Andrew up to the campus with me. They quite enjoyed themselves. They ran around the bookstore being little menaces and screamed when it was time to leave (at least Andrew did). Their school will start in the next couple of weeks. Andrew’s teacher called last night wanting to get more information about him. To see if he has any special needs or anything…So we let her know he is a bit high strung and can be a real bully. I guess it takes some a little longer to grow out of being preemie. But who wouldn’t love my precocious little monster! There is a lot of love and energy in that little kid.&lt;/p&gt;

I remembered reading from someone on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.planetn.org&quot;&gt;Planet N&lt;/a&gt; that OpenOffice files were just zip files. So I converted the pps to an sxd and then unzipped the file. There, all nice in neat in a directory called pictures, were all the image files. Run them through a little bash/gimp script. A little clean up of the html. Voila! Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

I had just been talking about this same problem with my father. [He works for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lockheedmartin.com&quot;&gt;LockheedMartin&lt;/a&gt;, as does my mother and father-in-law. As did his [my father-in-law’s] father and his father-in-law….hey! What happened to me!? Here I am working at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.novell.com&quot;&gt;Novell&lt;/a&gt;! Actually, I had been hired by Lockheed contingent on them winning a contract for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dimhrs.mil/&quot;&gt;DIMHRS&lt;/a&gt; project…which they didn’t :(]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My father indicated that Lockheed has felt the same way for sometime now. The space shuttle, for all its accomplishments, has not progressed space exploration at the pace it should have. It is after all, as the article points out, just a big truck! I know that I feel cheated by this. I am a huge fan of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.asimovonline.com/&quot;&gt;Isaac Asimov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hatrack.com/&quot;&gt;Orson Scott Card&lt;/a&gt; and others who filled my imagination with travel to distant worlds and living and interacting with AI (robots and other machines) and “people” from other worlds. None of which has happened. I had mentioned &lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/archives/2005/07/space_shuttle_f.html&quot;&gt;this earlier&lt;/a&gt;, but I think that it really says something that my son, Taylor, would rather work at mission control, than go into space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that when we first started to travel into space and then to the moon, it inspired kids (and adults) into studying and creating things that really helped propel us as a nation into being and staying a leader in technology and creating things we now enjoy. That is clearly being eroding in this day and age. I want to be inspired again by things that we do. I don’t find that much is happening to help us inspire young people to reach for the stars (or to the depths of the ocean). Instead we are locked into this idiotic hero worship of sports and movie stars….come on! Some of them may be bright, engaging, fascinating people, but get real! They are entertainers and provide little to no substance to our lives. I am not inspired by how they live their lives… I could not careless who ben is marrying or if jen still loves brad. They are all overpaid any way. I want my kids to be inspired by something awesome, that pushes them to achieve their dreams and pushes them from being locked on this planet to being able to enjoy the greatness of what surrounds them, not just on this world but on others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess their need for inspiration needs to start with me….&lt;/p&gt;

This will test and strain the family for a bit, but will be worth it. I have got her to agree to take the laptop with her to school. It’s a dual boot machine (Windows XP and Linux (SuSE 9.3)), she has been using it off and on since we bought it and is familiarizing herself with Linux, the default OS. [I have been thinking of removing the windows partition since I can’t remember when the last time someone used it.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been trying to put together all the apps that I think that she might need. These are already installed. Can anyone think of any that I am missing? Any good medical reference apps out there? Or, chemistry? Anatomy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OpenOffice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gaim&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tomboy&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Evolution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Beagle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Acrobat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was some discussion of the difficulty of the program (300 apply, 50 get in) this past &lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/archives/2005/08/dinner_with_fam.html&quot;&gt;Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t think that will be an issue for her. She graduated magna cum laude from MSU and has already set her sights on graduating summa cum laude from UVSC. She is a low achiever….typical slacker!&lt;/p&gt;

I was very impressed. I haven’t completed reading all of the setup, but it is up and running. I have run into some issues with the reverse proxy, but I need some time to figure out if it is me or some issue with how the proxy is suppose to work. I pulled a copy of mod_proxy_html.so from a mandrake rpm since I couldn’t find a suse built version. I also didn’t want to &lt;a href=&quot;http://apache.webthing.com/registration.html&quot;&gt;pay&lt;/a&gt; 50 Brithish Pounds for a pre-built binary. So I have posted it &lt;a href=&quot;http://jared.ottleys.net/xtr-content/mod_proxy_html.so&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for anyone that wants it. On SuSE linux, it should be placed in /usr/lib/apache2 with a symlink to it from /usr/lib/apache2-prefork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t done anything with the calendar part yet. My wife and I have needed a shared calendar for sometime and this will fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what Novell did by donating the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hula-project.org/General_FAQ#Relationship_with_Novell&quot;&gt;NetMail&lt;/a&gt; base code was genius. I think it is a great model for OSS. Like with IBM and the Cloudscape database….now called &lt;a href=&quot;http://db.apache.org/derby/&quot;&gt;Derby&lt;/a&gt;. I think that companies like Adobe should (And I know that this has been said before) give the code for the products that they are no longer going to support and give them to the Open Source community. They should choose a license that best fits their business needs. (Heaven knows there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opensource.org/licenses/index.php&quot;&gt;more than enough&lt;/a&gt; to choose from!) If they choose one that would allow them to take from the enhancements made by the community and incorporate them into the products that they continue to support commercially, (I am thinking here specifically about Golive and Dreamweaver. However, if they decided to drop ColdFusion, I think that there would be a lot of support for it to continue to exist as OSS. Also, JRun, which would probably be just be one more product in an already saturated market, could be given to the Apache foundation. I think its polished ‘commercial’ admin interface would be a great addition to tomcat.) I think they would benefit greatly from the innovation brought forth from the Open Source community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, why would they want to put products out there that could be competing directly with their own commercial offerings? They probably wouldn’t. I wouldn’t expect to see an Open Source version of Fireworks or Photoshop. But if modeled correctly, they could use the open source version of their software as stepping stones to the commercial offerings. It would probably take a couple of years to see a combined best of breed version of the similar product offerings from Adobe and Macromedia, but obviously, the model must work… think, the IBM WebSphere family and Eclipse, IBM’s DB2/Informix databases and Apache Derby, and now Novell’s Groupwise and Hula. I think that there are sound business models already in play that show that this can be very successful.&lt;/p&gt;

He threw up several times. One of them while on the top bunk…that of course went all down the wall behind the bunk bed, hitting not just his bed but Andrew’s as well. Olivia didn’t make the night any easier. It seems she is cutting her second tooth in a week. Needless to say, no soccer for Taylor today. It has been a good week for him at this camp. He is starting to really enjoy these little week long sports camps. We need to take some time and play them with him outside of the camps, but life has been very busy lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This past week, I worked several 12 hour days and then was on the computer when I was home. Needless to say, Adrienne was quite unhappy. I don’t see why. This is the trade off…I have a fairly flexible schedule. I have been able to go in late if needed (Like today, I watched the kids this morning, while she got some sleep), I can leave early (Like I may do today, if the kids are still sick). So if there are times that I need to work longer…don’t complain! (Don’t forget being able to leave in the middle of the day to go to sports camp, Dr. appointment’s, etc. and not being docked anytime…like I was in the last job! At that job, if you were 15 minutes late, you lost a half an hour of vacation and were required to work that 15 minutes during your half hour lunch.)&lt;/p&gt;

(Wonka freaking out at Charlie, going through the tunnel, Wonka’s spaced out look as he gives some of his dialog.) I could have done without the father thing with Willy Wonka in the new version. I couldn’t have cared less about how he became who he was.&lt;/p&gt;

It started out “Earn What You’re Worth.” It struck me as funny at first and then rather scary…Does someone really want to take the chance to have someone else pay them what they think they are worth? I know that for the most part we all probably over value ourselves. I mean really, if you think that others will value you at what you think that you are worth….you must be either really good and at level far above and beyond most or you are extremely delusional. I think that most of us are the latter. In this day and age you’d have to ask, ‘are you paying onshore or offshore wages?’ Are you paying a flat rate for the completion of the task or are you paying by the hour to complete it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few daring people who go out and do this…and some of them might actually be worth it. Very few of the ones that I came into contact with while employed by the Federal Government were worth half of what they were charging. There was one that I remember well being worth every penny we paid him. He eventually left the company he was working for and struck out on his own. Taking several of the clients he was working with from his former employer. Are you someone of this vein? I definitely felt that I was not getting paid what I was worth while working for the Federal Courts. (Besides not feeling appreciated or challenged and constantly second guessed by a boss who took the word of an incredibly untalented, unskilled (dated skills I should say) consultant (who charged 4 times what he was worth…literally). So to get a little of all of that, I left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can’t get all of that on your own. You’ve got to work for it. Now that I am in an environment that I feel is a bit more supportive of my own career goals, I must work to make that happen. If I am going to be someone that is paid what I feel I am worth, then I must make them see that I am worth more than what I am paid. (And money is not the only way to be compensated…there is trust in my abilities and more responsibility.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you are going to earn what you are worth be prepared to pay to get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have been reading about the solar system every night before bed this week. In the past couple of weeks Taylor has seen two different movies about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0167360/&quot;&gt;rockets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120591/&quot;&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; on TV. In both cases, he has said, he would rather work at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/audience/formedia/presskits/ffs_gallery_mcc_image2.html&quot;&gt;Mission Control&lt;/a&gt; than go into space.

&lt;p&gt;Notice the detail that Taylor has put on his shuttle glider. The first colors that he asked for were red and blue for the flag.&lt;/p&gt;

The trip over was fairly easy. We took Molly with us. She was very well behaved. You wouldn’t have even known she was in the car….which reminds me… I didn’t blog about this earlier because we wanted to surprise my parents, but we bought a new car…well Suburban. We are quite happy with it. It was a very comfortable ride. And we made it all the way to Denver (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.highlandsranch.com/&quot;&gt;Highlands Ranch&lt;/a&gt;) on a tank of gas with plenty left. True, it has a 31 gallon tank$$$ (you do the math).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have the boys raising their hands above their heads every time we go through a tunnel. As we were approaching one tunnel, Andrew had his hands part way up and said, “Not yet…not yet…not yet…YET!” And stuck his hands straight up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, we went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tinytownrailroad.com/&quot;&gt;Tiny Town&lt;/a&gt;. The boys liked riding the train and playing on the playground. They liked some of houses, and Adrienne said she wants us to build one of these houses for Olivia for christmas….um, we’ll see….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday we went to &lt;a href=&quot;http://englewoodgov.org/home/index.asp?page=353&quot;&gt;Pirate’s Cove&lt;/a&gt; in Englewood. It is amazing to think that it is owned and run by the city of Englewood. The place was packed and from what I heard we were there on a slow day.. The boys enjoyed the lazy river (You float in tubes around part of the part of the park). They have a large area of just kids pools and play sets. On the top of one the “forts” there is a large bucket that fills with water. As it gets close to being full, a bell starts to ring. And within a couple of minutes it dumps all the water down and on to the people below. They have several water guns on the forts that you can use to shoot water at people. I think that everyone really enjoyed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday was a lazy day, church and hanging out with family. We walked down to the park in the green space by my parents house. It was nice to get out and just walk around and play with the boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday, the Fourth, we went to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dmnh.org/main/en/&quot;&gt;Denver Museum of Nature and Science&lt;/a&gt;. We went first to see the exhibit on Space. Taylor made a sundial. The boys played in an area where they had a mock up of some controls for a space ship. We also walked over to this area by the planetarium where they have this huge globe. I spent some time talking to the boys about the planet, about where we live and where some of the people we know live. We talked about the land masses and the underwater mountain ranges. We talked about orbiting the sun and the moon orbiting the earth. I had this realization that it is difficult to explain to the boys the idea of planets and “outer space”. When thinking about it, I found that it was hard to wrap my head around it. That night we went to a friend of my parents house to watch the fireworks from their backyard. It was amazing to see some of the fireworks around the valley. If we could have been up on their roof we could have seen fireworks from pretty much the entire valley. Next year we should be here in Utah, so I want to take the boys to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.freedomfestival.org/&quot;&gt;Stadium of Fire&lt;/a&gt;….or really just to one of the parks near the &lt;a href=&quot;http://unicomm.byu.edu/images/about/photos/campus/FS13.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;lightbox[63]&quot;&gt;stadium&lt;/a&gt; so they can see the fireworks show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, we decided to take our time getting back home. It was amazing to see how awful people drive on highway 6 in Utah. We had several people cut in right in front of us when they ran out of space as they tried to pass us and a long line of cars on a two lane highway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all it was a good trip. It was nice to be able to spend time with my parents and not be overrun with other family members. (The house seems so small when everyone is there.) It is a good idea to have just family weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

As we were getting into the van to search for the fuse for the A/C, I asked Adrienne if she had meant to trim back the rose bushes as much as she had.

&lt;p&gt;As we were getting into the van to search for the fuse for the A/C, I asked Adrienne if she had meant to trim back the rose bushes as much as she had. She said she hadn’t trimmed any of them, just dead-headed a few. It seems someone came by and cut about a dozen yellow roses, and in the process basically cut the bush in half. I don’t think we would have had a problem giving someone a few roses, but cutting the bush in half, that is going to far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be pay back for when I took that &lt;u&gt;one&lt;/u&gt; rose from that house back in high school….pay back sucks!&lt;/p&gt;

The hottest day of the year so far, mid to lower 90s.) I thought at first that Molly had chewed all the way through the thermostat wires to the condenser. There was enough slack in the wires that I just cut the wires, pulled out the slack and then reconnected it. Still didn’t work. That is when I noticed a little flashing LED inside the A/C and a sticker on the outside that explained what the blinks mean. There was a short circuit in the 24v power supply….? While I read through all of the electronic schematics, Adrienne hit the Internet. She found the answer. There is a little 3 volt fuse, like the kind you have in your car. It had blown, It was also hidden behind a bunch of wires. So we went looking…Home Depot…nada…Wal-Mart..they had a mini fuse, but that wasn’t going to work…Auto Zone…Bingo! Went home, plugged that bad boy in…Cool air! It ran half of the night cooling the house down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it just about three-quarters of the way up. Taylor had the energy and strength to make it. He was determined to go all the way.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; We have to go to the Y and then we can go down.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
But the others either poured all the water they had to drink out or drank it. Andrew seemed to be on the verge of an asthma attack. So we turned around and went back. I think that we need to make a couple of short hikes to help build up the littler boys strength and stamina. But I won’t complain. They are just 4, almost 3 and almost 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olivia was doing just fine. She was in the backpack carrier and sang the whole way up. Adrienne wanted the sun to go down, but we were still a good two hours away from sunset [we were there just after 7 pm]. And Molly kept pulling her way up. On the way back down she kept wanting to stop and lay in the shade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hike was different than the short one we took in Gatlinburg, TN. There, the trail wasn’t as steep and we had a canopy of trees to help keep us shaded from the sun. The trail to the Y is completely exposed and steeper. I think that we may try the trail to Stewart Falls next. It is more like the Gatlinburg trail. And probably more along the lines of what the younger boys can do.&lt;/p&gt;

I didn’t get to see much of what happened in the orientation because Andrew and Cameron couldn’t sit still. So we went outside and sat on the grass until it was over. Andrew, being Andrew, had non stop questions about everything. Where is that bus going? What is that car doing? What are those people doing? Where are they going? What kind of tree is this? What are the roots for? How does it eat? I, early on in my fatherhood, decided to always give the most correct answer to any questions my kids asked. I wouldn’t dumb down the answers and tell them, “just because”. I would also tell them when I did not know the answer, and I would try to find out the answer for them or help them search for the answer. I would also try to let them know when something was my opinion. I would never talk to them like babies, or like some people talk to their children…I just find that condescending. Needless to say, I spend a lot of time talking. And sometimes it doesn’t appear that they are paying attention, but I have found that they have amazing retention, and incredible vocabularies for children ages 4 and under. Last night, Taylor was talking about something, and he used the word replica in a sentence (The pronunciation was a bit off, but we knew what he was trying to say). And he used the word correctly. It is one thing to hear a word and be able to say the word. It is another thing, to be able to use the word correctly. I have always believed that to be able to use a word, you must be able to explain what the world means. Hopefully, I can instill that in my kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no secret to the people that know me (or see me) that I dress like a slob. Sometimes. (I hate the idea of appropriate clothing for an occasion so much, that I have been known to dress up to lounge about the house, and dress down to go out.) At my last job, we were required to wear button down shirts and ties. I disliked it so much, I gave up ironing. On rare occasions, I will admit, that I did break out the iron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I was going to the MTC yesterday to see my brother-in-law off, I thought I would dress up a bit. Here, at my new job, they are a bit more “lax” about their dress code. I enjoy wearing shorts, a t-shirt and flip-flops. As I was dressing yesterday, it just felt so foreign and uncomfortable to be “dressing up” for work (The orientation is in the middle of the day). I kept thinking to myself, “How did I ever do this at the courts!? It is just not comfortable to be writing code with a tie on.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today of course, I wore shorts to work to rid myself of the ‘dirty feeing’ from yesterday. So, to all you people wearing ties while you are hacking away at some application….I am so sorry!!!&lt;/p&gt;

That once again all the right-wingers were being proved ‘right’, that the judicial system was completely corrupt and that it was time to rid ourselves of such an awful system [meaning the judges]. Well, I guess I shouldn’t be surprised, since they (he) got the the news of the verdict from the Sean Hannity Show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess it is the “&lt;em&gt;American&lt;/em&gt;” way to second-guess, arm chair quarterback every political, judicial, executive, business, sports decision ever made….Because of course “&lt;em&gt;we know better&lt;/em&gt;“. We have become a nation of pathetic people crying about what is so wrong, while not doing anything to fix a problem until it is too late. Or, saying there is a problem when we don’t have the faintest idea what we are talking about. [My apologies to those few of you who are not in this category.] So listen here dopes, if you see a problem, pull up your panties and try to fix it, don’t just sit there and cry about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will now put on my hat of experience here. [Oh, and here are my qualifications for this: I worked in the federal judiciary for 5 years, working directly with judges. I also have a degree in Political Science, and have worked in State Legislation, and worked on local, state, and federal campaigns…enough tooting.] There are problems. I think we can all acknowledge this. But more often than not, the people (judges, legislators, etc.) are doing what is right. Sure they have personality quirks and sometimes make bad decisions in their personal lives…don’t we all! The system laid out by our founding fathers (and mothers! You think these &lt;u&gt;guys&lt;/u&gt; could do this by themselves) is fairly sound. It has required some tweaking here and there, but it ain’t completely broke like some people want you to believe. And yes some bad legislation and decisions happen. And sometimes the people put in office the wrong person… (think W) What do you do when the choices you have are both bad candidates? We only have ourselves to blame for that. Take for example, in Louisiana, were one gubernatorial race the choice was between a bribe taking crook, who repeatedly made choices that helped fill his and his friends and families pockets with state tax dollars, driving that state further and further down, for what would be his third time in office or a former head of the Klu Klux Klan. Who would you vote for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, think before you answer, do you really think you know more about this case, than the 12 people sitting in that jury box? If you answer yes, I’ve got some ocean front property to sell you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: If you are complaining about this verdict and you complain about serving jury duty and do all you can to get out of it….I’ve got a foot for you…&lt;/p&gt;

Last round of shots for a year, and the inevitable spay. Adrienne went to the store later on to buy a bunch of stuff so Molly would be comfortable in the house. Adrienne said she started to cry when she thought about the fact that now Molly could never have puppies…what a sap….but then I started to think…maybe this is just a big conspiracy to rid the world of cats and dogs instead of being the responsible thing to do…maybe I am the sap!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Molly was pretty groggy when we picked her up. She has to stay in the house for at least a week. The first night went pretty well. She hasn’t had any accidents. She slept through the night. She lets us know when she wants to go out to do her business. She is staying in the kitchen and hasn’t torn anything up. What a good dog she is! I am sure that this is short lived and that she will be come a menace in the house, she is after all a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable Quotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I am going to add a section to the site where I can place quotes that I come across that I like. I have started to keep them on the white board in my office at work for now. The three that I have from the last couple of days are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fix the problem, not the blame. &lt;em&gt;-Japanese Proverb&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Most People think we are weird. That’s why we come here. &lt;em&gt;-NYTimes article&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We’ve gotten a little fat, a little dumb and a little lazy….Mmm. That sounds like the America I know. &lt;em&gt;-Exchange between Thomas Friedman and Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I missed the dogs spay appointment this morning (besides the fact that they forgot to tell me not to feed her the night before). Dad is in town to help with the basement, Beth and Ryan’s sealing (which of course means more time out of the office, which means, more catch up), and to look for property for when he retires. [Mom will show up on Wednesday.] So then you think it would slow down again. No! Parents leave Saturday morning and then mother and brother in-law show up Saturday afternoon. Brother-in-law Tristan is heading to the MTC. I need a vacation from life. Staying at work would probably suffice, since it is here that I usually forget about everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the basement is done, maybe I can lock myself in my new office. Oh, and I need to prepare sharing time for this Sunday. I think my life is going at the speed of frenzy at the moment. Soon it may change to chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

Adrienne asked why we hadn’t gone when we lived in Louisiana. Probably because the kids didn’t like water. They all had a blast. They played in the shallow end of the wave pool and in the kid pool. I think Taylor and Andrew will be very excited to start their swim lessons later this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

The animation was incredible (all done on Linux!). The movie over all was kind of so-so. The story was hokey. But it did start me thinking. There are lots of times when we are put into situations that are “unnatural” for us. Our behavior is contrary to what would be expected from us in a more common…natural environment. In the case of the movie, a zebra and a lion are friends in a zoo, but when placed in their natural environment, the wild, their behavior turns to what would be expected of them. The lion starts seeing the zebra as food not friend. I know there is probably some theory out there that explains this behavior. But it has me wondering, what situations I am in, or have been in, that have changed my behavior to something “unnatural” for me. I know I have been in situations where I have been ‘friends’ with or had to work with someone that I would not have been friends with or chosen to work with outside of the job/situation. But what others are there?&lt;/p&gt;

And I am not sure what the stand is on embryonic stem cell research. But I just don’t get what people are thinking. Stem cell research is important. And we need more of it &lt;u&gt;now&lt;/u&gt;. Maybe we ought to give people some sort of tax incentive for donating embryoes that they are just going to “throw away.” Every year thousands of embryoes are destroyed, for some reason or another (people don’t want them anymore, they don’t want their genetic child some where out there in the world). Why not put them to good use in helping to develop ways to help make the quality of life better for others. Yes, some people are adopting these embryoes and having kids with them, but that is just a small percentage. If you are not going to have kids with them and you are not going to give them to someone else to have kids with? They are doing what? Going to waste. Get smart people. [Yes, I have an extended family member who has MS so I am concerend about their quaility of life. Wouldn’t you be?] &lt;a href=&quot;http://stemcells.nih.gov/index.asp&quot;&gt;Get Educated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nationalmssociety.org&quot;&gt;National MS Society&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Stem cell therapy is not new&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; Some stem cells have been used successfully in medicine for almost 40 years. Bone marrow transplantation—which is a form of adult stem cell therapy—cures several forms of leukemia and anemia.
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; It is under investigation in MS, but the results are not compelling so far. (See News section, “Transplanted cells repair MS-like nerve damage in mice”.)
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; “Bone marrow transplantation, or more properly ‘hemopoietic stem cell transplantation’ (HSCT), involves a completely different therapeutic path than one for replacement of damaged brain cells,” said Dr. Stephen Reingold, director of the Society’s Research Programs. “It is an attempt to cure a disease by replacing a malfunctioning immune system with one that might function normally.”
&amp;gt; 
&amp;gt; The stem cells used for these procedures are harvested from a person’s own blood or bone marrow or sometimes from a donor, if a genetically compatible donor can be found. The concerns regarding other types of stem cells are not relevant to this therapy, since it uses adult stem cells.

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day Taylor and Andrew decided they wanted to play Star Wars. They took apart Olivia’s toy-bar and used the legs as light sabers. Andrew knocked down a picture from the mantel and broke the glass. Taylor keeps saying that he is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/yoda/&quot;&gt;Yoda&lt;/a&gt; and Andrew is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/countdooku/&quot;&gt;Count Dooku&lt;/a&gt;.

Did a lot (well not really, it just seemed like it) of yard work, went to Jawaad’s for dinner Saturday, saw Beth and Ryan for a couple of minutes on Sunday (they just got back from Hawaii; they seemed rested and relaxed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am, of course, burnt from the yard work. I need to remember to wear a hat and/or sunscreen. My neck, scalp, and calves all feel tender from the burn. Set up a visit with the courts. It will be nice to see them for a bit (even if the place is run by mad men – I am thinking of wearing my green pants in to see the chief, he hates them with a passion and I love to annoy him). Jeff Woods is even coming over from his new job to have lunch with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrienne wanted to get a new Camcorder, so we went looking and found this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;”center”&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://www2.panasonic.com/static//LargerPhoto/PV-GS150P_Open.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much nicer than our old Sony analog camera. Now I need to bust out all my old Abobe video editing software. And of course I couldn’t settle for just the camera, I had to get this as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div align=&quot;”center”&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very simple transfer of our old home movies to DVD. And the quality made me happy. It can double as a dvd-burner for the pc. Now I can back up the gallery. While the ability to sync movies to dvds is nice, I am still going to go back in and create a better menu system (need to create real chapters and better navigation to the different movies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taylor has turned into a Star Wars fan. He watched episode two on tv last night and loved every minute of it. He has bought in the the marketing campaign. He thinks Darth Vader is the coolest. Yesterday he said:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Yoda can take food from people. (&lt;em&gt;Pepsi commercial&lt;/em&gt;).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
He has more or less memorized the book &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060271639/&quot;&gt;Rolie Polie Olie&lt;/a&gt;. He can recite verbatim pretty much the entire book. We checked it out from the library just over a week ago. The kid amazes me. Last week he started telling me about stuff that we did from like two years ago. He is only 4! He can carry on conversations about shows that we watch on TV. I was driving him to school one morning and we were listening to a report on NPR about something happening in India. The reporter was Indian. He says:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; Dad, remember on that show last night that guy Bug {&lt;em&gt;Crossing Jordan reference&lt;/em&gt;}. [&lt;em&gt;He starts laughing - because Bug had said or done something funny on the show.&lt;/em&gt;]&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
Verbal clues! He picked up on verbal clues and drew ties between something he saw on TV and something he was listening to on the radio. Amazing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrew’s potty training is starting to hold. He stays dry through the night now. And is starting to prefer going in a bathroom, instead of in his underwear. He is also starting to go to sleep on his own. The last couple of nights when I put the boys down for bed, he has asked if he could lay down in the toddler bed instead of on the bunk bed with Cameron and me. Last night he comes into the bedroom and says that he needs help. I figure that he needs to go to the bathroom or wants to get into bed with Adrienne and me. No. I follow him into his room where he climbs back into the toddler bed and says:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; I’m cold.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
I put a blanket over him and he goes back to sleep. Big steps coming from the little guy. He will be ready to go to pre-school this fall if he keeps this up. (He can also recite parts of the book with Taylor.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cameron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cameron had a rough weekend. Asthma attack on Saturday. Adrienne took him to the ER late Saturday night, early Sunday morning. He now has a bunch of medicine for the nebulizer. He seemed to be doing a bit better Sunday night. His breathing wasn’t as rapid this morning, but you could still tell there was still some congestion and constriction. His vocabulary is growing quickly. Lots of new words everyday. And of course he wants to do whatever everyone else is doing. So he is trying to potty train himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Olivia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olivia has been affected by the pollen. No asthma attack, but she is puking a lot. She is getting herself up on her knees from laying flat on her belly. She can army crawl. She has also found her earings and is starting to play with them. She loves her brothers, and is always watching and smiling at them. Cameron makes her laugh. That makes us all laugh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;!--more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, Adrienne is correcting every entry….stupid English major.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was Taylor’s last day of school, they all came up to campus for lunch. Afterward we headed over to a canal that runs along the edge of the parking lot to feed the ducks. Andrew was bossing the ducks around. Cameron was afraid of them. Taylor went looking for the swans. We also saw catfish in the canal…crazy! Catfish in Utah! We need to get another digital camera. There are so many things that you could take pictures of around here, and I never have a camera!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather is starting to warm up. It is hard to believe there is still so much snow in the mountains right now. The reservoirs are full and there is still a lot of snow pack to melt. Can anyone spell flood season?&lt;/p&gt;

Being a responsible member of the community means helping. And that means more than talking (i.e. complaining) about the problems. There is a feeling of satisfaction in helping to improve the quality of software that people use everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently moved positions to being a component tester in the NSS lab. The work is interesting. It is working at a level much lower than I have before. (I mostly did n-tier, client/server, and web development in my previous life.) I have been working lat earning what work is currently automated, what the automation does, what I need to automate, testing new builds, regressing past bugs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I most recently have been working on a bug that has had people scratching their heads. (Lucky for me I inherited the bug from someone else who knows what they were doing.) Today I discovered that the defect was not in the product, but in the tool we were using to test it. Now, I could have just left it at that, not informing the developers of the open source product of the problem. That is probably what the typical response would be. But by choosing to inform the developers, I choose to help the community. We all benefit by helping each other improve the products that we use everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is part of what being a member of the open source community is, working together to make software that works, that enables people to do things at a minimal cost. In my previous life I worked in the Federal Judiciary. It just boggles my mind how much money the government could save by turning to an open-source model. That is tax dollars that could go from buying expensive proprietary software to money used to help those people that really need it (I won’t get into my political views here, but this is a political movement if you really think about it…).&lt;/p&gt;

He asked me about several articles in the magazine (One on getting your product to market before your competitors and one on getting government funding).

&lt;p&gt;In the car on his way to school, we talked about combustion engines.

&lt;p&gt;Also, got &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick&quot;&gt;Kevin Mitnick’s&lt;/a&gt; new book from the library, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0764569597/103-1090005-8455854&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Art of Intrusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A must read for anyone with some influence on IT in their organization (or home). And even for those just curious. Smart, security educated users = better security. Unless that happens, people won’t learn from the mistakes that are made when it comes to computer security. It proves once again, that the hackers are one step ahead of you. (And sometimes more. Especially, when you are several steps behind…Helped my sister get her laptop up to date on patches and virus definitions yesterday. Laptops can be a cesspool if they aren’t kept up to date!) And while you will not be able to stop them completely, you can at least help to slow them down. So remember: Keep patched; keep virus definitions up to date; Run periodic scans for viruses, trojans, and spyware; Lock your computer when you walk away from it; Periodic password changes are good; Write security policy of the least common denominator, and give more explicit rights only when justifiably needed; If your applications require you to run with rights that are higher that what should be needed, it is time to look for some new applications (you should really complain to the manufacture about it)… there are more, but are you getting the point? The cliché is, “You are only as strong as your weakest link. But it is so true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had Amanda, Beth and Ryan over for dinner on Sunday. BBQ’ed out on the deck. It appears that we are missing a stopper on the lid of the BBQ.

&lt;p&gt;Also hung blinds in the kitchen. That finally covers the windows we want to have blinds on.&lt;/p&gt;

Telling the members of the church to stop gambling. No big deal. I have always believed that the Church has frowned upon gambling. And, I admit that I have been involved in a few friendly games of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.learn-texas-holdem.com/&quot;&gt;Texas Hold’em&lt;/a&gt;. We never bet on anything. So what makes me laugh about this? How about this…within a week of this talk, local government gets involved by &lt;a href=&quot;http://sltrib.com/search/ci_2645696&quot;&gt;enforcing an already existing law the outlaws gambling in the state.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, add to this…Target is now running a sale on all of its gaming supplies. 30 to 75% off. Now is the time to buy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easy to see how non-members can easily become frustrated with the church and local government. It is pretty difficult to tell people that there exists a valid separation of Church and State in Utah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spent most of the weekend searching out humidifiers and hepa filters. The house has become so dusty. It is really affecting Andrew’s asthma and we are all feeling kind of blah. Hopefully we can get the dust out with new filters (hepa, vent, air return). The humidifier thing has turned out to be a mess. Adrienne bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.gsp?product_id=2371706&amp;amp;cat=46321&amp;amp;type=1&amp;amp;dept=101849&amp;amp;path=0%3A101849%3A115643%3A192026&quot;&gt;floor unit&lt;/a&gt; wal-mart. The boys just played with all the buttons and knobs. So we returned that one and bought a &lt;a href=&quot;http://yourhome.honeywell.com/Consumer/Cultures/en-US/Products/Humidifiers/Do-It-Yourself/Bypass+Flow-Through/Default.htm&quot;&gt;whole house unit&lt;/a&gt; from home depot. That would have worked out really nice, but there is just so little room to work with around the ac/heater/water heater. So we had return that one too. Adrienne went and bought a couple of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.holmesproducts.com/estore/humidifiers.aspx&quot;&gt;tour units &lt;/a&gt;from target. Even worse. One was missing half of the stuff from the box, and the one that was complete leaked all over the floor. So those went back too. We ended up using the cool mist vaporizer. That seemed to work the best. Andrew and I had sinus drainage all night, but everyone else slept really well.&lt;/p&gt;

I have instant access to all the files that I use on a regular basis, anywhere, anytime. I regularly use several different computers (lab, office, home) and those files are always there. A couple of weeks ago, I started thinking about those settings for applications that I use on a regular basis (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eclipse.org/&quot;&gt;eclipse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beatniksoftware.com/tomboy/&quot;&gt;tomboy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/&quot;&gt;firefox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://gaim.sourceforge.net/&quot;&gt;gaim&lt;/a&gt;, etc.)…why not keep those files in iFolder too? So that is what I did, I copied over either specific files (my bookmarks from firefox), app files (gaim, tomboy) and source files (eclipse) into ifolder and then symlinked those directories and files. Now when I add a bookmark, have a conversation with someone, add a note, etc., I have it on all my computers. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.jawaad.net/&quot;&gt;Jawaad&lt;/a&gt; asked about windows…what would I do if I needed to add a windows machine in to the mix. How do I get to those files since windows does not support simlinks? Well, some applications let you specify where these files are located, either through preferences/options or in the registry. Or most of the ones I am using are open-source, so I could modify the code to point to the iFolder directory. Not as simple as the linux solution but still possible. (I’ll have to try it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am waiting for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ifolder.com/&quot;&gt;iFolder3&lt;/a&gt;, enterprise server edition. No longer tied to a single directory to store these files. (Not to say that the p2p version is not cool too. I am going to use that to share files with family and friends.)&lt;/p&gt;

I walked around with Olivia for quite a while. It is nice to have the md player now. I listened to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poetsofzwan.com/?media_main=biglist&quot;&gt;Zwan&lt;/a&gt;. I had forgotten how much I liked this band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Sony, I have a couple of requests for the MD player. Now, I know that some of the features I request are going to appear in some of the newer players and may exist in some “higher” end models. But I think that these should be standard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MP3 format should be the default format. I know this is coming so I’ll leave it at that.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Linux supprt. This is a must have. There are a couple of OSS projects around netMD, but not with Hi-MD. It looks like a new project needs to be started, or you could provide us with a utility…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Back lit. This has been a major let down. It is pretty difficult to move through the playlist in the dark. I seem to be trying to do this a lot, since I am up late with Olivia.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;USB 2.0. Now, with the Hi-MD format, you need this kind of speed to move the larger amounts of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

I can go &lt;a href=&quot;http://sage.mozdev.org/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; place and read it all. But once someone picks up the feed, what do they have the right to do with it? So I am thinking of removing it from my blog. At least for now….maybe….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first example in the article is something that I thought a lot about before I started the blog. What information do I want to share and what can I share. &lt;a href=&quot;http://adrienne.ottleys.net&quot;&gt;Adrienne&lt;/a&gt; is kind of laying off blogging right now. She said,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;gt; “it seems a very conceited thing. like, oh, i am so interesting that people want to read this stuff.”&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
But it makes it so easy to share with others (family, friends, etc) what is going on. And there are things that I do not share, because I don’t know who is going to be reading this. There are also things that I just shouldn’t or can’t share.&lt;/p&gt;

Needed to make more room to start working on finishing the basement. The space looks even bigger now that all the stuff was moved to the lower basement or thrown away. This week I plan on finishing the move of the dryer duct, and cut, cap and seal the drain pipes (3-4 on the floor, on in the ceiling). When I remove one of the pipes I need to get a reducer to replace the ‘t’ that is in the ceiling. The fourth on the floor is where a toilet was going to go. I need to figure out if they will have something big enough to fit that. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lowes.com&quot;&gt;Lowes&lt;/a&gt; website has a much better selection, but I find that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.homedepot.com&quot;&gt;Home Depot&lt;/a&gt;‘s is easier to navigate.) Then I should be able to frame the wall behind the washer and dryer. When Dad comes next, I think we will work on adding in the plumbing for the wash sink. A lot of work left to go, but it will be nice for &lt;a href=&quot;http://adrienne.ottleys.net&quot;&gt;Adrienne&lt;/a&gt; to have a real nice, large laundry room / sewing / office / storage room. It will also get me that much closer to having my office done!&lt;/p&gt;

In my new job, I don’t have much need for a laptop to do what I do, but if I had a laptop…I could be that much more productive. My laptop was part of me. Everywhere I went, it went. Adrienne would often say that I cared more about the laptop than I did about the kids. Sorry, kids but… No, I love my kids. (Even if they spent 20 minutes last night telling me that they hate me and that they don’t like me, just because I want them to go to bed at a decent hour.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With my laptop I worked all the time. If the kids wanted to play or watch a movie, I could sit there and watch them while I work. It is a bit harder now that I have just a desktop that is not in the room where all the action is. I would take my laptop with me to my in-laws, on vacation or to the library on story night. I had everything I needed on it: books, movies, music, documentation, IDEs, games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you have a laptop that is looking for a good home…&lt;br /&gt;
It doesn’t have to be new or the fastest. (A wireless card and a dvd/cd-rw would be nice.) I have a good, loving home for it. It would never want for anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss my laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
