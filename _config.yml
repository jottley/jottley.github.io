title:            I exist as I am
tagline:          Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.<br/> --Ralph Waldo Emerson
description: 

#I exist as I am, that is enough, If no other in the world be aware I sit content, And if each and all be aware I sit content. One world is aware, and by the far the largest to me, and that is myself, And whether I come to my own today or in ten thousand or ten million years, I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness, I can wait. â€• Walt Whitman
