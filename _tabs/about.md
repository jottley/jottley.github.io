My name? **Jared Ottley**. I am a Principal Engineer at *[Hyland Software](http://www.hyland.com/)* working on the Alfresco Platform. I've worked on the Alfresco Platform for 18 years. I started at Alfresco in 2007 as employee number 51 as a Solutions Engineer.  I've also worked as a Senior Consultant and an Integrations Engineer while at Alfresco.

I've worked with Alfresco customers across North America, Australia, and Japan.  As an Integration Engineer, I worked on integrations with Jive, Dropbox, Google Docs/Drive, and Salesforce.

I started the *[Alfresco PDF Toolkit project](https://github.com/OrderOfTheBee/alfresco-pdf-toolkit)*.  I am the current maintainer of the *[Spring Social Salesforce project](https://github.com/jottley/spring-social-salesforce)*. You can find several other Alfresco Add-ons that I've developed under the Projects link above.

Before Alfresco, I worked as a QA Engineer at *[Novell](http://www.novell.com)*.  I worked on the OES Integration Test Team as the Linux Technical Lead testing components and features of Netware, OES 1 & 2 and SLES 10. I covered the storage aspects of those products (Netware: Hardlinks, NFS APIs, Byte Range, and Cross-Protocol Byte Range Locks, OPLocks; OES Linux: NSS Hardlinks, NSS NFS APIs, NSS VFS, NSS xAttr; SLES10: Multipath and Storage Management). I also worked on install, configuration, virtualization with XEN, LUM (Linux User Management), Linux Platform Patching and Updates, and Dynamic Storage Technologies(Shadow Volumes).

Before Novell, I worked for the *[US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals](http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/)* in several positions.  At the Court of Appeals I helped to develop an Event Management web application (first in Cold Fusion then using the Struts Framework).  I maintained applications written in several different languages.  I worked the Help Desk providing hardware and desktop support for court users in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.  I was the administrator of a small web hosting service for federal courts across the Central US.

Outside of work, I've coached youth and high school lacrosse in Springville Utah for the last 14 years.  For the last 5 years, I've been the head coach for the Springville High School Boys Lacrosse team.
