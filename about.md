My name is **Jared Ottley**. I am an Engineer at *[Alfresco Software](http://www.alfresco.com/)*.  I started at Alfresco in 2007 as a Solutions Engineer.  I've also worked as a Senior Consultant and an Integrations Engineer while at Alfresco.  
  
  
I've worked with Alfresco customers not only in the US and Canada, but also Australia and Japan.  As an Integration Engineer I worked on integrations with Jive, Dropbox, Google Docs/Drive and Salesforce.  
  
  
I founded the *[Alfresco PDF Toolkit project](https://code.google.com/p/alfresco-pdf-toolkit/)*.  You can find several other Alfresco Add-ons that I've developed under the Projects link above.  
  
  
Before Alfresco, I worked as a QA Engineer at *[Novell](http://www.novell.com)*.  I worked on the OES Integration Test Team as the Linux Technical Lead , QA testing components and features of Netware, OES 1 & 2 and SLES 10. I covered storage aspects of those products (Netware: Hardlinks, NFS APIs, Byte Range and Cross-Protocol Byte Range Locks, OPLocks; OES Linux: NSS Hardlinks, NSS NFS APIs, NSS VFS, NSS xAttr; SLES10: Mulitpath and Storage Management). I also worked on install, configuration, virtualization with XEN, LUM (Linux User Management), Linux Platform Patching and Updates, and Dynamic Storage Technologies(Shadow Volumes).  
  
  
Prior to Novell I worked for the *[US Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals](http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/)* in several positions.  At the Court of Appeals I helped to develop an Event Management web application (first in Cold Fusion then as a J2EE application).  I maintained applications written in several different languages.  I worked the Help Desk providing hardware and desktop support for court users in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.  I was the administrator of a small web hosting service for federal courts across the Central US.  
  
  
I have a degree in Political Science with a minor in Philosophy.  My area of focus was Campaigns and Elections with a primary emphasis on the use of the internet as a campaign tool.
