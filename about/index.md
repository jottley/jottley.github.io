My name&#8230;Jared Ottley (well duh /=).

I am a Technical Consultant for <a href="http://www.alfresco.com" target="_blank">Alfresco</a>, an Open Source Software start-up, which develops an [Enterprise Content Management Platform][1].  Beyond helping with Alfresco implementations, I also help provide training.  I worked with Ingres on developing their Alfresco appliance and with Canonical on the initial release of the Alfresco Community package for Ubuntu.  I started at Alfresco as a Solutions Engineer in 2007.

Prior to working for Alfresco, I was a Software QA Engineer at <a href="http://www.novell.com" target="_blank">Novell</a>. I worked on the OES Integration Test Team as the Linux Technical Lead , QA testing components and features of Netware, OES 1 & 2 and SLES 10. I covered storage aspects of those products (Netware: Hardlinks, NFS APIs, Byte Range and Cross-Protocol Byte Range Locks, OPLocks; OES Linux: NSS Hardlinks, NSS NFS APIs, NSS VFS, NSS xAttr; SLES10: Mulitpath and Storage Management). I also worked on install, configuration, virtualization with XEN, <a href="http://www.novell.com/documentation/oes/implgde/index.html?page=/documentation/oes/implgde/data/lum.html" target="_blank">LUM</a> (Linux User Management), Patching and Updates, and [Dynamic Storage Technologies][2] (Shadow Volumes).

I enjoy working from home and split time between work, a <a href="http://adrienne.ottleys.net" target="_blank">wife</a>, six kids, two dogs and an ever growing honey-do list.

I like to play chess and [go][3]. I an avid music fan&#8230;anything from punk to folk, and even a little bit of Hip Hop. I&#8217;ve recently taken up <a href="http://photography.ottleys.net" target="_blank">photography</a> and like to spend time learning not just the art of photography but the tools for editing and managing the images.

In a previous life I worked as a J2EE Developer/ Architect for the US 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, Louisiana. While employed by the Federal Courts I also worked as Internet Administrator (Webmaster/Sysadmin for about 50+ different Federal Courts websites), on the Help Desk and as a PC Technician.

I have a degree in Political Science with a minor in  Philosophy from BYU, where I studied the use of the Internet as a Campaign Tool in Congressional Elections.
