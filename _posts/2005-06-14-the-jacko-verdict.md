You&#8217;d swear, based on the reaction of some of the people in the office, that the world was coming to an end. That once again all the right-wingers were being proved &#8216;right&#8217;, that the judicial system was completely corrupt and that it was time to rid ourselves of such an awful system [meaning the judges]. Well, I guess I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised, since they (he) got the the news of the verdict from the Sean Hannity Show.

I guess it is the “*American*” way to second-guess, arm chair quarterback every political, judicial, executive, business, sports decision ever made&#8230;.Because of course &#8220;*we know better*&#8220;. We have become a nation of pathetic people crying about what is so wrong, while not doing anything to fix a problem until it is too late. Or, saying there is a problem when we don&#8217;t have the faintest idea what we are talking about. [My apologies to those few of you who are not in this category.] So listen here dopes, if you see a problem, pull up your panties and try to fix it, don&#8217;t just sit there and cry about it.

I will now put on my hat of experience here. [Oh, and here are my qualifications for this: I worked in the federal judiciary for 5 years, working directly with judges. I also have a degree in Political Science, and have worked in State Legislation, and worked on local, state, and federal campaigns...enough tooting.] There are problems. I think we can all acknowledge this. But more often than not, the people (judges, legislators, etc.) are doing what is right. Sure they have personality quirks and sometimes make bad decisions in their personal lives&#8230;don&#8217;t we all! The system laid out by our founding fathers (and mothers! You think these <u>guys</u> could do this by themselves) is fairly sound. It has required some tweaking here and there, but it ain&#8217;t completely broke like some people want you to believe. And yes some bad legislation and decisions happen. And sometimes the people put in office the wrong person&#8230; (think W) What do you do when the choices you have are both bad candidates? We only have ourselves to blame for that. Take for example, in Louisiana, were one gubernatorial race the choice was between a bribe taking crook, who repeatedly made choices that helped fill his and his friends and families pockets with state tax dollars, driving that state further and further down, for what would be his third time in office or a former head of the Klu Klux Klan. Who would you vote for?

Now, think before you answer, do you really think you know more about this case, than the 12 people sitting in that jury box? If you answer yes, I&#8217;ve got some ocean front property to sell you.

PS: If you are complaining about this verdict and you complain about serving jury duty and do all you can to get out of it&#8230;.I&#8217;ve got a foot for you&#8230;
