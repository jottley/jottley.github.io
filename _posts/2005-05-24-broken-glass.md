When I got home last night the boys where in full spazz out mode. I took them outside for a bit and we walked the dog. [Adrienne][1] was a bit overloaded. She went and ran some errands to get some time for herself. She is a tad bit overworked. <img src="http://jared.ottleys.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

Earlier in the day Taylor and Andrew decided they wanted to play Star Wars. They took apart Olivia&#8217;s toy-bar and used the legs as light sabers. Andrew knocked down a picture from the mantel and broke the glass. Taylor keeps saying that he is [Yoda][2] and Andrew is [Count Dooku][3]. They then proceed to battle it out. Crazy little monkeys!
