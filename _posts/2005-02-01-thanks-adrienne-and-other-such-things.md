Now that I have cleaned up some of the grammer and spelling problems of previous entires, I need to thank [Adrienne][1] for my new [mini disk player][2]! Now I can zone out even more when she starts to talk about how much I can&#8217;t spell.

I&#8217;ve helped Mom setup an account on [Spencer&#8217;s blog][3]. She is going to start posting his letters home.

Saw a reference to a cool [web application][4] on [Nat Friedman&#8217;s blog][5] for a wiki. I am thinking about replacng the static site at [www.ottleys.net][6] with that.
