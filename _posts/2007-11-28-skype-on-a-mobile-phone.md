At <a href="http://www.alfresco.com" target="_blank">Alfresco</a> we are big users of <a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank">Skype</a>. [Matt][1] has even <a href="http://blogs.cnet.com/8301-13505_1-9803895-16.html" target="_blank">dropped</a> [Vonage][2] to use Skype as part of his primary business phone (Skype plus some other VOIP service). I, on the other hand, have been using Vonage as my home phone for nearly 3 years and am very happy with it. One of the important things for someone who works at home (and is taking care of family while his <a href="http://adrienne.ottleys.net" target="_blank">wife</a> is on bed rest) is staying in contact. I installed the Skype mobile client on my phone. It is great. I can stay in contact while I am taking kids to and from school/activities. It is a bit of a battery hog but well worth it. A week or so ago, I went to lunch with the younger of my kids (those not is school) and Adrienne. (Yes, she is on bed rest, but she can get a bit stir crazy and so I try to get her out of the house once a week for a meal not prepared by me.) While at lunch one of the sales guys IMs me over Skype, that he needs someone to take a call to answer some questions. I mention that I am not near a computer (it is lunch time) and that if the call needs that kind of attention it will be a few minutes before I can get home to call the potential customer. He assures me that it won&#8217;t need that kind of attention and then pauses, &#8220;Wait, if you are not near a computer&#8230;how was I just chatting with you over Skype?!&#8221; After a few quick pointers on where to look and I can feel the excitement over the phone.

This conversation reminds me that I ought to check and see if there is an update to the version of Skype I am using on my <a href="http://www.samsungblackjack.com/" target="_blank">phone</a>. When I check, I see that Skype has partnered with <a href="http://www.iskoot.com" target="_blank">iSkoot</a> for a new mobile client. This I need to try. It is a complete rewrite, cutting out some of the battery hogging features and <a href="http://www.iskoot.com/products.php" target="_blank">enabling things</a> like calls over your mobile line to Skype users. Now I don&#8217;t have to worry so much about the quality when I am on an edge network instead of G or 3G network. So I decide this is something worth trying and go to install it. Let&#8217;s just say that the install process left much to be desired. After a lot of tries, I finally got it installed. I haven&#8217;t tried it since, but I want to say it was a temporary network issue, <a href="http://jared.ottleys.net/alfresco/alfresco-website-and-email-down" target="_blank">not that Alfresco hasn&#8217;t had our own issues in this regard</a>. Now that it is installed, I am quite happy with it. It is easy to use. Call clarity is good. And battery life&#8230;.there is a huge change.

If you have a mobile phone, and you use Skype and can afford the data fees, it is well worth it.
