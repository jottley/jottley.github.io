As you can tell I have updated my blog. New look, new software.  After using MT for so long I decided it was time for a change.  WordPress just happens to be more along the lines of what I want, better plugins, easier to use, etc.

Now for something else&#8230;While watching General Conference and taking somenotes, I wanted to be able to look up really quickly a scripture using a Mozilla search plugin.  However, when I found one, it was broken.  It seems that when it was written, the <a target="_blank" title="http://scriptures.lds.org" href="http://scriptures.lds.org">LDS scriptures</a> site used a different search url.  Oh well, time to dig in and figure out how it works.

It is actually rather [simple][1]. After a bit of hacking, I have updated the original plugin written by Marlo Bell.  It should work on any browser that supports Apple&#8217;s Sherlock standard.  I have not tested on anything beyond Firefox. If you encounter a problem, please let me know and we will work out a solution.  
Hopefully this can be useful to someone besides me <img src="http://jared.ottleys.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

Here is the [link][2].  I&#8217;ll add a permanent link on the side bar of the blog.
