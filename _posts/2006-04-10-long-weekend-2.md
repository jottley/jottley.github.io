We took my Mom to the airport this afternoon. She came to help out with <a target="_blank" href="http://adrienne.ottleys.net">Adrienne</a>. (For those who may not know, we had our 5th child March 15th, <a target="_blank" href="http://gallery.ottleys.net/gallery/v/current/BenjaminSawyer/">Benjamin Sawyer</a>.) Adrienne&#8217;s Mom had been here to help out before. It was a real help. It made it possible for me to keep working with little down time. And made Adrienne&#8217;s life a lot easier. She had an emergency c-section. Quite a scary event. She went in for a regular checkup and the nurse midwife told her not to move. She asked why only to be told that the nurse had the babies feet in her hands. They did not want to risk anything. Her placenta had detached and had ruptured. Luckily, her OB has his office at a hospital. Things worked out great. Baby and Mom were OK. Mom came away with a 12-inch incision and a renewed out look on life.

So now to the weekend&#8230;.

On Friday I spent the evening working on this [blog][1] site going through the error log. When you change blog software, you have a lot of links that no longer match up to what search engines, aggregators, and bookmarks match any longer. So spent time creating <a target="_blank" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_alias.html#redirect">redirects</a> for archives, RSS feeds, resume, and misc. files. It is really interesting to see what people are looking for and can&#8217;t find.

>     Saturday we took the kids to get Easter pictures taken. <a target="_blank" href="http://gallery.ottleys.net/gallery/v/taylor/">Taylor</a> did not want to cooperate on the way there and <a target="_blank" href="http://gallery.ottleys.net/gallery/v/olivia/">Olivia</a> didn&#8217;t want to get her picture taken once there. Taylor had an all around bad day. After pictures Adrienne and I headed off to Home Depot for some tools and gardening supplies. Mom stayed with the boys. Taylor did not like the fact that he was going to have to wait to ride in the jeep. So he ran away. And far. Down the street and around the corner and almost to 1600 North. A rather busy street. Luckily, sense kicked in and he turned around.

Spent sometime catching up on the teams current defects and planning for the rest of the week. It was a short day since I needed to take Mom to the airport.
