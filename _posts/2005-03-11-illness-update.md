Spent the morning at the doctor&#8217;s office. 4 kids, 8 ears, 7 infections. Add on top of that, Asthma. Andrew, Cameron and Oliva all had breathing treatments for asthma. It doesn&#8217;t appear that Taylor has it right now. Adrienne has been sending me a lot of info on what we need to do to the house to help them. Right now she wants me to rip out the carpet and put down pergo. I am all for finding a good solution, but I still have a basement to finish!
