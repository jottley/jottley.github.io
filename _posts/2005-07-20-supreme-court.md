I was so hoping that CNN was going to be [right][1]. Edith Brown Clement is one of the few Judges on the short list with whom I had some interaction with in my last job (E. Clement, E. Jones, E. Garza &#8212; weird all E&#8217;s). I would have loved to dish some dirt&#8230;.but it doesn&#8217;t look like that will happen. Something [tells][2] me the Court isn&#8217;t going to get any better with this [nomination][3] anyway.
