We just finished upgrading our home server. The migration, while it took time, was rather easy. I combined our separate blogs all under a WordPress MU install to simplfy maintenance. One thing that I am happy about with the upgrade, besides improved performance, is that the iPhone wordpress app now works. I had errors connecting before. One thing that helped in configuring the app is improved error handling in the latest version. The initial release would always just die when trying to connect with no errors. I tried sniffing the connection, but unsuccesfully. 

As I contiunue to use the app, I&#8217;ll update you on to what I like and don&#8217;t like. For now I&#8217;m happy!
