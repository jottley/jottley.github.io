This past Friday was my last day at [Novell][1]. Monday I will start at [Alfresco][2] as a Solutions Engineer.

I loved working at Novell. It was a hard decision to leave. I worked with a great bunch of people. I had the opportunity to work on the release of [OES 1][3], [SLES 10][4], and the upcoming release of [OES 2][5].

I am lucky that in my new position I will get to remain in the OSS world. Alfresco has a [great product][6] and a [very bright future][7].
