Saturday, [Andrew][1] and I got into a disagreement&#8230;  
> *Me:* Andrew, whose [house][2] is this?</p>
> *Andrew:*It&#8217;s [George Shrinks&#8217;][3] House.

> *Me:* Where is our house?

> *Andrew:*It&#8217;s far away from here.

From the first day he saw the house, he has said this is George Shrink&#8217;s house. We can&#8217;t convince him otherwise.
