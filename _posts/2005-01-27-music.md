At work yesterday, I came across a song in my collection from a band called [Signor Ros][1]. I didn&#8217;t know anything about them so I thought I&#8217;d check out their website for more [info][2]. They also have a nice collection of [mp3s][3] for you to sample. I like the fusion of classical and &#8220;trance&#8221; (I think that is what you would call it).
