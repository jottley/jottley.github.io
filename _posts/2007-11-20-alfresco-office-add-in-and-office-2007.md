Seeing some of the searches that had brought people to my post on <a href="http://jared.ottleys.net/alfresco/alfresco-and-microsoft-office-integration" target="_blank">Alfresco and Microsoft Office Integration</a>, I thought I would add this little tidbit: The add-in was designed to work for Office 2003, but <a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Microsoft_Office#Compatibility_with_Microsoft_Office_2007_and_Windows_Vista" target="_blank">it can work with Office 2007</a> as well.

From the <a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com" target="_blank">Alfresco Wiki</a>:

> Although the Alfresco Add-Ins have been designed with Microsoft Office 2003 in mind, they are compatible with Microsoft Office 2007, with the following caveats:
> 
> *   Before installing the Add-Ins, ensure the **.NET Programmability Support** option has been installed for each of the Office applications you are installing the add-ins for. Normally these will be Word, Excel and PowerPoint. 
>     *   The options can be found by running the Office Setup program and expanding the list of available options for each application.
>     *   You may need your original Office 2007 install media in order to add these essential components.
