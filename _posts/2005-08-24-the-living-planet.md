This past Monday we went to the preview exhibit for the new &#8220;possible&#8221; aquarium in SLC, [The Living Planet][1]. It is a nice, small (10,000 sq ft) exhibit. It appears that this is mostly a fundraiser and market research. They want to know if it is, or will be, worth it to open an aquarium in Utah. I take it they don&#8217;t want to run into the problems that the Denver aquarium &#8211; [the former, Ocean Journey][2] &#8211; [did][3].

Coming to Utah from a city that had a very nice [aquarium][4], that we went to at least 4 times a year, it will be nice to have the aquarium here. Now we just need to take a look at the [zoo][5]. It is not the [Audubon zoo][6], but it is a zoo.

Say what you will about Utah being more kid friendly than New Orleans, but they just can&#8217;t cut it when it comes to something like what [Audubon Nature Institute][7] has to offer.
