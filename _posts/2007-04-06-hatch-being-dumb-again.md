Why Utahans continue to reelect this man is beyond me. He <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/hatchletter4-5.jpg" rel="lightbox[122]">claims</a> to have been speaking of someone else but had used the wrong name. Can you trust anyone who gets their information from Rush? No. No farther than you can throw Rush.

The problem with Hatch, or those who work for him is that they have continually done just stupid things and Hatch says something stupid that ironically coincides with the act. I [remember][1] when his webmaster was using an unlicensed dhtml navigation script. Hatch, at same time, was spouting off about wanting the ability to send commands over the Internet to destroy the machines of those downloading music illegally.

Another 6 years of this guy&#8230;hrmph&#8230;Maybe the world will end soon.
