When we started discussing names for Parker we ran through a bunch. We tried to figure out if we could continue on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_device" target="_blank">mnemonic device</a> that we stumbled upon with our kids names, TACOS (if you go by what we call them) or JACOB (if you go by given names): Taylor, Andrew, Cameron, Olivia, Sawyer or Jared, Andrew, Cameron, Olivia, Benjamin. But there just wasn&#8217;t anything that sounded right.

We agreed early on that we liked Parker, and had settled on Mathew Parker. About a month ago, Adrienne came to me with a suggestion, earlier this year I lost my grandfather, and Adrienne suggested that we change the name we had chosen so that we could honor my grandfather. It wasn&#8217;t a hard decision. We hadn&#8217;t told my step-grandmother about the decision to change his name. I got this forward, written by my step-grandmother, to me by my mom today:

> I was so moved to learn that Jared and Adrienne named their son Parker **Forrest** Ottley. Jared has always been so good about keeping in touch with his Grandpa. It means so much that he has honored his Grandpa in this way. Please tell him that I love him.
