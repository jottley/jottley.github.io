From <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/" target="_blank">Rands In Repose</a>:

> Here is an audacious goal for your resume: to get you to a point in your career where you no longer need a resume. It&#8217;s the point that in your chosen industry people know who you are and what you are capable of. And they want you doing it at their companies.

Amen.
