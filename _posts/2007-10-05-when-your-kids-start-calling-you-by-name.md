I was downstairs late last night checking mail and catching up on some reading. <a href="http://gallery.ottleys.net/gallery/v/olivia/" target="_blank">Olivia</a> has been having some trouble getting to sleep at night. So she is in and out of her room until just about midnight. Adrienne was upstairs wanting to watch a movie. Olivia decides she needs to get me to come upstairs. And instead of hearing the typical &#8220;dada!&#8221; I hear &#8220;Jawed! &#8230; Jawed!&#8221; Most of my kids know my name. But they still don&#8217;t call me by it. When I ran upstairs, I asked her &#8220;What did you call me?&#8221; To which she responded &#8220;Nuffing.&#8221; And ran off to her room.
