Tonight is Adrienne&#8217;s last night working at American Fork Hospital.  She will now be working as a librarian at the Springville Library.

Working at the hospital, while not cutting in to normal family time (She worked mostly weekends from 6pm to 6:30 am), had a physical toll.  Switching to the library (which is about a mile from our new home), where she will work just a few hours a night, a few days a week, will be less stressful on her.  And, we can come up in the evening and spend time &#8220;with&#8221; her.
