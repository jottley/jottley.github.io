[Adrienne][1] called and asked if I wanted to go with them on a picnic after she picked up [Taylor][2] from school. We spent about an hour and a half at [Kiwanis Park][3] in [Provo][4]. Lunch was simple, but healthy. It was nice to spend time with the [boys and Olivia][5] and run around the park. Couldn&#8217;t do much of that at the Courts.
