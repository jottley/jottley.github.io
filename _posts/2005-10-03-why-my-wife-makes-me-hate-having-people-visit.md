&#8230;it is the anal cleaning, all day, every day, for at least a week before they arrive.

True, she does most of the work, but if you want to have peace at home, you have to help. By the time they arrive, you are too tired to enjoy their company. Then when they leave you have the dread of cleaning once they are gone.

Luckily (or, unluckily, depends on your point of view) for her, my anti-social behavior doesn&#8217;t kick in until after they arrive.
