Up late&#8230;second week in a row. I need to start setting the alarm. Worked out ok. Olivia was congested. So Adrienne stayed home from church with her.

I have started to spend sometime going through old code from past projects. I want to clean it up and post it on the site. Who knows, someone may find it useful. I think that for the most part it all comes from my work at the courts. I just pull out the useful snippets and classes. (It is all java for now.) I&#8217;ll limit it to my work, as I have source that a couple of different people worked on / wrote.

Ho hum&#8230;why won&#8217;t the boys go to sleep!?
