I was supposed to work this weekend. I brought [Andrew and Cameron][1] to work with me on Saturday. We left around 10. Nothing was really happening where they would have needed me. Since I thought I was going to be working, I didn&#8217;t do anything on the basement&#8230;.well, I cleaned up the rest of the loose computer stuff. I need to sketch out what we want done.

We went to [Bajio&#8217;s][2] for dinner. Sorry, Aidan and Jermey, but this is better than [Moe&#8217;s][3]. Tempted to go back for my birthday, but I think we will step next door and go to [Tucanos][4]. So good!!!

Finished [<u>Angels and Demons</u>][5]. Good book. Dan Brown has a good formula.
