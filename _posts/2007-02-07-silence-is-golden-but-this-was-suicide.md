So after nearly a year of silence a post. Lots of things to come as a lot has changed in the last year.

But first this&#8230;In a recent conversation at work we started talking about Super Bowl ads (I haven&#8217;t watched the Super Bowl in years, because the game has become so boring). I mentioned that my favorite ad was from 10 years ago.

It is a Holiday Inn ad, that aired only once. One of the reasons it has stuck with me for so long was because it was so progressive for the time. It still makes me laugh today.

(grr. I tired to embed the video and it didn&#8217;t work. Some where there is a setting I need to change.)
