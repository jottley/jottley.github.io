Yesterday, I upgraded my laptop to [SUSE 10][1]. So far, so good. I did have to go hunting for rcd and its related accoutrement. I found it, but then was told today that I could have used the version built for [9.2][2]. (or on the 9.3 cds) I know I could use apt or YAST repositories, but I am a fan of rcd and [open-carpet][3]. I have run into an issue with [Eclipse][4]. (Bug [106699][5]). I haven&#8217;t had much time to look into it yet, but it was comforting that other people have the same problem&#8230;.well sort of.

This will stop, momentarily, migrating my desktop at work (I like to use Eclipse for some of the things I do), but the servers (home and office) should be fair game.

Other things I noticed&#8230;.

**iFolder3** I had to reconfigure this. Not difficult, but annoying.

**Evolution** The launcher needed to be updated to use the right command. Also changed the icon, not a big deal, but I like the new look.

If I encounter others, I&#8217;ll let you know.
