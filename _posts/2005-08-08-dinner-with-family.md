So we had my sisters over, with their families, for dinner last night. It was a pretty nice little BBQ. Sat around talked while the kids played. Molly was pretty well behaved&#8230;she was tied up most of the time. Towards the end we brought her up on the deck with us. She sat in my lap and just enjoyed the attention. All in all it was nice. Now that I have had the family over, that should meet the family quota until Christmas!
