I haven&#8217;t blogged for a while&#8230;.mostly because I am lazy&#8230;.but also because I have been living under a cloud. But now that has [lifted][1]. I wanted to unload some of my emotions about the event but I don&#8217;t think this public pulpit is really the place. So I will say this, it is hard being a bystander and watching it happen. I haven&#8217;t worked at a place that had lay offs before. I have seen people fired&#8230;.but that was just one person at a time. It was hard to watch friends and colleagues being asked to leave. I can&#8217;t say that I would want to be in my bosses shoes either. He has been visibly drained emotionally for several weeks. I have to say that my boss is a good man. He fought for us everyday. Right now I wouldn&#8217;t want to work for anyone else.
