Now [this][1] is sad. Once again evidence that schools and parents just aren&#8217;t doing enough to teach kids. It may be that schools won&#8217;t touch the subject for fear of what will happen (i.e. lawsuits). Parents are too busy letting the schools &#8220;educate&#8221; their kids while they are transfering to kids their &#8220;opinions&#8221; of what is right, instead of what actually is right. (Any takers on that one?)
