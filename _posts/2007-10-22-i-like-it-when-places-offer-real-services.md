I am at the OB&#8217;s with Adrienne.  This is a critical visit, after her <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_fibronectin" target="_blank">fetal fibronectin</a> test came back positive<a href="http://adrienne.ottleys.net/the-mom/the-joys-of-pregnancy/" target="_blank"> this last week</a>.  I came with my <a href="http://www.samsungblackjack.com/" target="_blank">phone</a>, ready to use it as my network connection (that little gem was hidden, I&#8217;ll post how to enable it later).  Being able to work anywhere is important.  And seeing that you can spend a lot of time just sitting at a doctor&#8217;s office, having an internet connection would be a great service.  That is why I like her doctor even more now.  Besides being a great OB/GYN, they have free wifi. <img src="http://jared.ottleys.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
