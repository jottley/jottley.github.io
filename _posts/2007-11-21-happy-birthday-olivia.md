It has now been three years since you joined our dysfunctional family.  And a happy three years it has been.  One of the perks about working from home is that I get to see you all when you wake up.  I love how you search me out in the morning and coming running to me with your beautiful smile and give me a great big hug.  I love how excited you are about all things girl: ballerinas, princesses, dolls, but that you can turn around and play legos, star wars and cars with your brothers.  You are the perfect fit for our family. Happy third birthday.  I love you little princess.
