Over the past few weeks I have had the chance to do a couple of presentations.Â  One at [UTOSC][1] on [Enterprise Document Management][2] and another as part of the [Alfresco Developer Series][3] on building [VMWare Appliances with Alfresco][4].

Links to the slide decks are [here][5] and [here][6].

A recording of the VMWare Presentation can be found [here][7].
