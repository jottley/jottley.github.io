I have finally updated my [resume][1]. (Jawaad has been encouraging me to update it and submit it for some positions in Lebanon, NH (Former [Tally Systems][2] offices)). Took off some of the more useless jobs that I had done previously and combined some of the jobs that I had been doing for the same employer.

I also found and deleted the old tripod hosted website that I had back in college. That site is slower than having the site hosted from home!
