My flight out of Islip was delayed for weather.  Once we hit the gate in Atlanta, I had two minutes before my connecting flight to Salt Lake was to leave.  Needless to say, I didn&#8217;t quite make it.  I hate the Atlanta Airport.  I always have.  I have yet to have a connection in Atlanta where first and second legs were both in the same terminal. (Try running with two kids in a double strolle, with all their carry-on, plus your own across 2 concourses.  Not fun.)

So they put me up in a Comfort Suites.  Not the nicest place, but it is a bed.  Up at 5:30 to get my shuttle back to the airport.  Now waiting for seat confirmation.  I want to be on this flight.  I am ready to be home.  It is funny, I can complain about the noise the kids make&#8230;all the time&#8230;.at home.  But these trips bring home to me that I wouldn&#8217;t want it any other way.  The quiet of the hotel gets to me.  I love being able to sit down and have one of the kids to talk to.  I love in the morning have Olivia come into my office, give me a hug, and ask for breakfast. I love talking computer games with with boys, or playing Go with Taylor. I love having Adrienne next to me.  I miss her the most.  It will be good to be back home.
