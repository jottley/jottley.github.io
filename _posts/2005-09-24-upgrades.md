I had planned to upgrade the servers and my laptop to SUSE 10 this weekend. But with Adrienne unexpectedly heading into the dentist yesterday, I didn&#8217;t have a chance to burn the ISO files. If I have a chance, I may head in to the office later today and and burn them.

I have upgraded the blogs to Typepad 3.2 and also upgraded the gallery to version 2. The admin portion of typepad is much nicer than the last. Gallery is much improved. Administration, configuration, plugin architecture, etc. What I miss and hope that someone gets working soon is RSS. It wasn&#8217;t perfect in version 1, but it did make knowing when my wife updated the gallery a bit easier. If I had the time I would try to learn some php to help with the existing working being done on adding this feature.

So much to do, so little time. Maybe if I slept less&#8230;.
