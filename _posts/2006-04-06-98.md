Spent most of the day working on iSCSI. Trying to put the / device on a storage array over iSCSI. I can start to make it happen by loading the iscsi_tcp kernel module, starting the daemon, and discovering and logging into the target before moving too far into YaST. Entered a couple defects on the process, they are probably based more on my inexperience with this process, than anything actually being wrong.  
For the last week I have been trying to work on being more effective with my time. It seems like I can accomplish a lot, but don&#8217;t seem to be spending my time very wisely. Read parts of the series &#8220;<a target="_blank" title="How I Work" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/03/20/8371781/index.htm">How I Work</a>&#8220;. I first came across the series when I read <a target="_blank" title="Bill Gates" href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/30/news/newsmakers/gates_howiwork_fortune/index.htm">this</a> by Bill Gates. It is by far more useful than the others in the series. One common thread across them all was, that they started their days early (typically between 5 and 6). Hmmm, the question now is can I be discipled enough to continuously wake up that early?

Tonight was bath night. And someone was a little too excited about it.
