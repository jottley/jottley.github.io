Easter came early this year. Adrienne&#8217;s brother is in town, and will travel back home to Texas on Sunday. This afternoon turned out to be the best time for a family Easter get together, so I took off from work a little early. We went to [Brick Oven][1] in [Provo][2] for lunch. We then headed to the house for a little indoor Easter egg hunt. If our yard still wasn&#8217;t dirt, we would have done it outside.
