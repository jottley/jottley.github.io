Kids can sometimes suprise you with what they remember from what they have learned or heard from you and others (TV, people you pass, school, etc.).

A couple of things the boys have said lately:

Andrew (2 yrs): Took Cameron and him to the [8th floor breakroom][1] to look out the window. As he approached the window and got excited by the height, he said, &#8220;Whoa, I just pooped my pants!&#8221;

Taylor (3 yrs): Playing in the family room he exclaims to his brothers&#8230;&#8221;What the crap are you doing!?&#8221;

Taylor (3 yrs): Eating dinner at Pizza Hut&#8230;He points to something on his pizza and says&#8230;&#8221;What the hell is on my pizza!?&#8221; [[Adrienne][2]]: &#8220;What did you say?&#8221; [Taylor]: &#8220;Um..what is that on my pizza?&#8221;

Cameron (1 yr): Not so much what he says, but [how][3] he says it&#8230;Asking him to do something&#8230;&#8221;No!&#8221;
