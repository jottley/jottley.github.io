My friend Jeff, a former co-worker, sent me a link to [INDEXED][1], a blog by Jessica Hagy. She uses charts, graphs and Venn diagrams to explain her observations.

Also a few jokes from his seven year old niece:  
> Q: What has a broom and flies?</p> 
> A: A jelly covered janitor!
> 
> Q: What is green, fuzzy, has four legs, and if it lands on you it will kill you?
> 
> A: A pool table!
