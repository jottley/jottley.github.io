The boys and I spent some time this past Wednesday, putting together the [space shuttle gliders][1] that we got from my Mom this past weekend. It was fun. (These things haven&#8217;t changed since I was a kid.)

We have been reading about the solar system every night before bed this week. In the past couple of weeks Taylor has seen two different movies about [rockets][2] or [space][3] on TV. In both cases, he has said, he would rather work at [Mission Control][4] than go into space. [[Press Kit Gallery][5]]

Notice the detail that Taylor has put on his shuttle glider. The first colors that he asked for were red and blue for the flag.
