**Update:** Long time coming but, after taking her to the emergency room, they told us that she had torn ligaments in her hand. She had to wear a sling. She has since recovered and is as much of a spoiled princess as ever <img src="http://jared.ottleys.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />

It has become a tradition, not a good one, but a tradition none the less. We go on a family vacation, we go to the ER. I spent almost a week one Christmas, when we visited my parents in Denver, in a hospital with my son Andrew. RSV.

We have taken kids to the ER in Louisiana for dehydration and high fevers when we visited my in-laws.

Now my daughter Olivia is on her way to the ER here in Southern California, for what appears to be a dislocated wrist. Can you dislocate your wrist?
