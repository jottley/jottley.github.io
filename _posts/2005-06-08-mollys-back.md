So I dropped off Molly (the dog) at the vets yesterday. Last round of shots for a year, and the inevitable spay. Adrienne went to the store later on to buy a bunch of stuff so Molly would be comfortable in the house. Adrienne said she started to cry when she thought about the fact that now Molly could never have puppies&#8230;what a sap&#8230;.but then I started to think&#8230;maybe this is just a big conspiracy to rid the world of cats and dogs instead of being the responsible thing to do&#8230;maybe I am the sap!?

So Molly was pretty groggy when we picked her up. She has to stay in the house for at least a week. The first night went pretty well. She hasn&#8217;t had any accidents. She slept through the night. She lets us know when she wants to go out to do her business. She is staying in the kitchen and hasn&#8217;t torn anything up. What a good dog she is! I am sure that this is short lived and that she will be come a menace in the house, she is after all a dog.

**Notable Quotes**

I think I am going to add a section to the site where I can place quotes that I come across that I like. I have started to keep them on the white board in my office at work for now. The three that I have from the last couple of days are:

> Fix the problem, not the blame. *-Japanese Proverb*

> Most People think we are weird. That&#8217;s why we come here. *-NYTimes article*

> We&#8217;ve gotten a little fat, a little dumb and a little lazy&#8230;.Mmm. That sounds like the America I know. *-Exchange between Thomas Friedman and Jon Stewart*
