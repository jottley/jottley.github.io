In July, <a href="http://adrienne.ottleys.net" target="_blank">Adrienne</a> and I were up in <a href="http://www.parkcity.com/" target="_blank">Park City</a>, for a weekend without the kids.  We stopped at a bookstore&#8230;yes we like books&#8230;and found a [LEGO advent calendar][1].

It has been a big hit with the kids.  One that I hope will become a family tradition.

What are things that you do during the holidays, to express your, or your families inner Geek?
