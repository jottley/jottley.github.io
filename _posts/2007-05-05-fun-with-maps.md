One new, one old.

(old) I found [newsmap][1] a while ago. It is a visual representation of the [Google News][2] Aggregator. Want to know what stories are getting the most play on the news sites? The larger the block, the more links to the story.

(new) [The World From Your Window][3], shows the collection of pictures sent into the [Daily Dish][4], [Andrew Sullivan][5]&#8216;s blog at [The Atlantic][6]. Add yours by sending pictures to <andrew@theatlantic.com> (include location and time).
