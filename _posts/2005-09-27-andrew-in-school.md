Andrew&#8217;s transition into preschool has not been as easy as Taylor&#8217;s. (The first day of school Taylor just walked right in to class. No good-byes. No hugs. No tears.) Andrew has been very excited about going to school for sometime. And he is pretty willing to go to class. But once he walks through the door&#8230; he takes three steps in, stops cold and then proceeds to either hide is face in his hands or pull the hood of his sweatshirt over his face.

I usually drop him off first, walk Taylor to class and then return to check on Andrew&#8230;still in the same spot, as if frozen in time. This past Friday, he was thrown for a loop when he walked into his classroom to find a substitute teacher. Luckily it was Taylor&#8217;s teacher from last year. That helped raise his comfort level&#8230;a little.

On Monday, we were running a bit late. As we entered the school, Andrew saw his teacher at the door. He ran into his classroom. I thought, &#8220;Yes! It looks like things are changing.&#8221; I walked Taylor over to his class and then headed back over to Andrew&#8217;s to see how he was doing. And just like Lot&#8217;s wife, frozen three steps in.

I thought he had made a leap forward, but it was more like baby steps. It will just be one day at a time for him.
