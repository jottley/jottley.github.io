I hate wire clutter.  Having worked in IT for almost 8 years now, (6 1/2 professionally and 1 1/2 years while a student) I know wires are everywhere.  For that reason, the kids computer, in the new house, will be setup to run wireless.  Wireless network, wireless keyboard, wireless mouse. Anybody know when there will be a wireless (bluetooth) monitor? That leaves just the power cord.

But the home office will be another story.  With at least two servers, a desktop, a laptop and all the peripheries&#8230;.and don&#8217;t forget the line into the house (cable modem, wireless router and VOIP router) &#8230;wires will be everywhere.  So when I saw this [post][1] (link to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gearfuse.com/diy-declutter-your-desk-using-um-all-of-your-space/">original post</a>) at [Make][2], I thought &#8220;now why didn&#8217;t I think of that.&#8221; <img src="http://jared.ottleys.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
