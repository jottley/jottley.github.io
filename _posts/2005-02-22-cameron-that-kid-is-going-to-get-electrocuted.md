[Cameron][1] has a fascination with plugging cords into sockets. He does it with the vacuum cleaner, night lights, the xbox, etc. Yesterday, he got ahold of my laptop power supply. I was in the basement and heard him plugging something into the wall. So I go into the family room to see what he is doing. He is, of course, plugging the power supply into the wall. He looks up and sees me and starts to run. He runs over behind the ottoman lays down on the ground and starts to try to push himself under the couch&#8230; the couch is about two inches off the ground!
