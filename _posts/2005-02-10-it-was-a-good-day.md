We had a nice get-together with family last night. We all went out to eat at [Tucanos][1]. The food is so good. Then we went back to the house for [cake][2]. The cake was well worth the price! There is still a lot left, too. For my birthday I received the previously [mentioned][3] [mini-disc player][4] (which I am very happy with), an [Ansel Adams][5] book about his [National Park Series][6], and a new X-box game, [Full Spectrum Warrior][7]. Some nice stuff. Thanks to all who gave. None of it will go to waste!

Put up faux wood plantation blinds in the living room Tuesday night. Had to buy a new drill. The one I had just wouldn&#8217;t cut it. The blinds add a nice bit of privacy to the front room and make the living room feel more cozy.
