I am pretty excited, [Adrienne][1] will be starting on her second Bachelors degree in two weeks at [UVSC][2] in [Nursing][3]. (Her first degree is in [English][4] from [Mississippi State][5].) This will test and strain the family for a bit, but will be worth it. I have got her to agree to take the laptop with her to school. It&#8217;s a dual boot machine (Windows XP and Linux (SuSE 9.3)), she has been using it off and on since we bought it and is familiarizing herself with Linux, the default OS. [I have been thinking of removing the windows partition since I can't remember when the last time someone used it.]

I have been trying to put together all the apps that I think that she might need. These are already installed. Can anyone think of any that I am missing? Any good medical reference apps out there? Or, chemistry? Anatomy?

*   Gaim
*   Tomboy
*   Evolution
*   Beagle
*   Acrobat

There was some discussion of the difficulty of the program (300 apply, 50 get in) this past [Sunday][6]. I don&#8217;t think that will be an issue for her. She graduated magna cum laude from MSU and has already set her sights on graduating summa cum laude from UVSC. She is a low achiever&#8230;.typical slacker!
