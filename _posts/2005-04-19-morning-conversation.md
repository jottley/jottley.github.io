After Taylor finished breakfast this morning, he started to flip through the current of issue of [SmallTimes][1], a magazine on [nanotechnology][2] and microsystems. He asked me about several articles in the magazine (One on getting your product to market before your competitors and one on getting government funding). This started a conversation about what nanotech is, which led to a discussion on physics and how everything is made up of smaller parts, and how there are things all around us that we can&#8217;t see.

In the car on his way to school, we talked about combustion engines. We spent most of our time talking about trains, and the differences between Thomas (a tank engine) and Diesel (a&#8230;diesel engine)[find out more about these two at the [train depot][3]].

Not bad topics for a three year old!
