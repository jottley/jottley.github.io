We have been experiencing problems with our registrar and DNS.  It is in the process of being resolved.

If you need/want to get hold of someone at Alfresco.  You can use @alfresco.org as the domain for email.

All of our sites are available through their IP addresses:

*   http://www.alfresco.com  &#8211; please use http://88.208.218.102/
*   customers.alfresoco.com and partners.alfresco.com -  please use http://88.208.200.70/alfresco/
*   forums.alfresco.com  &#8211; please use http://217.174.252.22/

I really can&#8217;t think of anything worse that can happen to a company that depends on the internet for their business.  Please bare with us as we get this fixed.  Changes are underway to make sure this won&#8217;t happen to us again.

We are extremely sorry for the inconvenience this has caused our customers and potential customers.
