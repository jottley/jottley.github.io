Just finished another Alfresco in an Hour.  An hour of me talking non-stop about <a href="http://www.alfresco.com" target="_blank">Alfresco</a>.  I should have had a glass of water next to me.

You can get past recorded version of Alfresco in an Hour in the <a href="http://www.alfresco.com/community/register/?source=community" target="_blank">Alfresco Content Community</a>.

(Alfresco in an hour is a weekly webinar that gives you an overview and demo of Alfresco with time for questions at the end of every session.)
