We went to Moe&#8217;s for lunch today. They were really busy and short-staffed. But they were still very cordial. Adrienne felt sorry for them and wanted to do something nice for them. So I offered to take the garbage out for them (which was overflowing). In return they gave me a couple of coupons for free food (which were passed onto my in-laws). It makes me wonder&#8230;are there other places where I can go and trade some service for food, or other things?
