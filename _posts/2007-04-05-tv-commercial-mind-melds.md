Just read this [post][1] by [Ken Jennings][2]. We are also suffering under the mind meld of tv commercials. We can&#8217;t seem to go to the store without hearing Taylor regurgitate word for word, some faulty reasoning as to why he needs a toy or food.

At first it was kind of funny. Now it is just scary. It makes me think of the recent news story (can&#8217;t find the link right now) that talked about limiting advertisements or banning advertisements on websites related to kids tv shows or something. I learned from the article that there are limits on the number and length of advertisements associated with programming focused at children.

I understand the need for the limits now. It can be very trying to reason (You ask &#8220;why are you trying to reason with a child?&#8221; Well because I think that they can understand sound logic.) with my kids over every toy or every food they want to buy. ( I found [this article][3] from the journal [Pediatrics][4], which should make for fascinating reading on the topic.)
