This is short notice, but we have another Alfresco training class this month.  This will be an excellent class, getting down into the details of designing content models, configuring the web client and a bonus section on configuring custom dashlets (Dashlets are like portlets on the My Alfresco Dashboard).   The 2-day class will be held in Reston Virginia.

The class will be taught by Louis LaFontisee, our Global Education Manager.

The Content Modeling & Web Client Configuration course builds upon the skills you learn in the System Administration course, enabling you to configure Alfresco even further.
