I have been mulling over this [video][1] posted by [Andrew Sullivan][2] at [The Daily Dish][3]. And I have to admit that I am confused&#8230;.who are they protesting against? It seems to be a hodge podge of polar opposites. There are the obvious ones, but when you watch it (if you watch it), try to make sense of it. Why do they think we eat our kids? Why are they grateful for IEDs? Why are the grateful for 9/11? Why are they glad that miners were trapped? What do they have against Canada? And then the image montage of heads&#8230;.I just say &#8220;huh?&#8221;

UPDATE: The video that the post was linked to before has been removed. [Here][4] is a new one.
