Adrienne goes to work and Olivia pukes. All over the couch, all over the carpet, all over herself. The acrid smell of bile gives me headaches. Clean up and give Olivia a bath.

While bathing her, Andrew runs in:  
> Andrew: &#8220;I want to take a bath.&#8221;  
> Me: &#8220;Do you need to take a bath?&#8221;  
> Andrew: &#8220;Yes. Why is Olivia taking a bath?&#8221;  
> Me: &#8220;She threw up.&#8221;  
> Andrew: &#8220;She has puke on her?&#8221;  
> Me: &#8220;Yes.&#8221;  
> Andrew: &#8220;Alright. She can take a bath.&#8221;</p>
Andrew exits (quickly) stage left.
