I have been cleaning out a lot of papers from <a href="http://www.byu.edu" target="_blank">University.</a> In them I found a couple of quotes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miyamoto_Musashi" target="_blank">Miyamoto Musashi</a>. I was first introduced to Musashi when I took a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotokai" target="_blank">Shotokai </a><a href="http://clubs.byu.edu/shotokai/Index.html" target="_blank">karate class</a>. The class was held in the school&#8217;s <a href="http://newsnet.byu.edu/story.cfm/57827" target="_blank">wrestling team</a> practice room (the perfect room for this because of its padded floors.) These two quotes were framed on the wall.

    <p>
      I wouldn&#8217;t call Musashi ordinary. But he is. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s extraordinary about him. He&#8217;s not content with relying on whatever natural gifts he may have. Knowing he&#8217;s ordinary, he&#8217;s always trying to improve himself. No one appreciates the agonizing effort he&#8217;s had to make. Now that his years of training have yielded such spectacular results, everybody&#8217;s talking about his &#8216;God-given talent.&#8217; That&#8217;s how men who don&#8217;t try very hard comfort themselves.
