I needed to upload 177 photos into the <a href="http://gallery.ottleys.net" target="_blank">family photo gallery</a>.  Doing this by hand through the web interface was just not appealing.  Neither was adding another <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/Gallery_Remote" target="_blank">application</a> to manager the transfer.  A quick search resulted in [iphoto2gallery][1]. Yeah!  Quick install, easily configured and boom!  Photos uploaded.
