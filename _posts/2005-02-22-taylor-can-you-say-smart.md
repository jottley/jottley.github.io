Yesterday, [Taylor][1] and the boys were watching Barney (I know, I know). And in the show they start to sing &#8216;[Twinkle, Twinkle, little star][2]&#8216;. Taylor starts to sing along&#8230; &#8220;Twinkle, twinkle, little star, How I wonder what you are&#8230;&#8221; And he says &#8220;It&#8217;s a giant, glowing ball of gas.&#8221;

A few minutes latter he is jumping backwards onto the couch and says, &#8220;Hey, Mom, I am action-packed!&#8221;
