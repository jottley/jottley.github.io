On Saturday, April 2nd, [President Gordon B. Hinkley][1], (President and Prophet of the [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints][2]) talked to the Priesthood holders of the Church about the evils of [gambling][3]. Telling the members of the church to stop gambling. No big deal. I have always believed that the Church has frowned upon gambling. And, I admit that I have been involved in a few friendly games of [Texas Hold&#8217;em][4]. We never bet on anything. So what makes me laugh about this? How about this&#8230;within a week of this talk, local government gets involved by [enforcing an already existing law the outlaws gambling in the state.][5]

Now, add to this&#8230;Target is now running a sale on all of its gaming supplies. 30 to 75% off. Now is the time to buy!

It is easy to see how non-members can easily become frustrated with the church and local government. It is pretty difficult to tell people that there exists a valid separation of Church and State in Utah.
