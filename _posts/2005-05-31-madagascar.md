Went to see [Madagascar][1] with the boys tonight. The animation was incredible (all done on Linux!). The movie over all was kind of so-so. The story was hokey. But it did start me thinking. There are lots of times when we are put into situations that are &#8220;unnatural&#8221; for us. Our behavior is contrary to what would be expected from us in a more common&#8230;natural environment. In the case of the movie, a zebra and a lion are friends in a zoo, but when placed in their natural environment, the wild, their behavior turns to what would be expected of them. The lion starts seeing the zebra as food not friend. I know there is probably some theory out there that explains this behavior. But it has me wondering, what situations I am in, or have been in, that have changed my behavior to something &#8220;unnatural&#8221; for me. I know I have been in situations where I have been &#8216;friends&#8217; with or had to work with someone that I would not have been friends with or chosen to work with outside of the job/situation. But what others are there?
