I have missed about a week worth of fun stuff happening at the Ottleys&#8217;. So I will try to remember what has happened. Well, [Adrienne][1] took pity on me and let me get a [laptop][2]. She is already complaining that I am spending more time on it then helping with anything else. (That is probably true, but I am making an effort to not get too distracted by it&#8230;honest I am&#8230;) Everyone is slowly getting over what ever illness they have. By some freak miracle [Andrew][3] did not get sick. I guess his little body just knows how to fight off things that the rest of us can&#8217;t.

This past Saturday, Adrienne and [Olivia][4] went to Amanda&#8217;s little party. So I took the boys for a drive around SLC. We went by the [temple][5], the [U][6], the [Hogle Zoo][7], the [This is the Place monument][8], went to get [ice cream][9] and to their favorite place&#8230;the [airport][10]. Andrew began screaming as we left, &#8220;Stop! Stop! We have to get on a horplane!&#8221; He was pretty upset when I told him that we couldn&#8217;t. That kid loves to fly.
