As we were getting into the van to search for the fuse for the A/C, I asked Adrienne if she had meant to trim back the rose bushes as much as she had. She said she hadn&#8217;t trimmed any of them, just dead-headed a few. It seems someone came by and cut about a dozen yellow roses, and in the process basically cut the bush in half. I don&#8217;t think we would have had a problem giving someone a few roses, but cutting the bush in half, that is going to far.

It must be pay back for when I took that <u>one</u> rose from that house back in high school&#8230;.pay back sucks!
