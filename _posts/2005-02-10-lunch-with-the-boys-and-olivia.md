Adrienne just came up for lunch. The boys were good at first, but toward the end they became pretty wild. Andrew walked into the revolving doors, but not quite far enough. He was stuck half way in. But it was nice to have them come. It&#8217;s something I never got to enjoy at the courts.

I forgot to mention earlier that we took a [family picture][1] last night for the McGrath Mardi Gras/Easter card/letter.
