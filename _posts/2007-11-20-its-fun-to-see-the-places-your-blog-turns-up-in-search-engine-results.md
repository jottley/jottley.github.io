I have this blog monitored through several different programs: <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>, <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/" target="_blank">Feedburner</a>, and <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/stats/" target="_blank">WordPress Stats</a>. Each of these have their own pluses and reasons why I use them. Probably the most interesting and most useful is the search terms used to find the blog or posts on the blog. It can help you <a href="http://jared.ottleys.net/alfresco/alfresco-office-add-in-and-office-2007" target="_blank">refine information</a> on your blog or make you laugh (I used to be on the first page for search results for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Shrinks" target="_blank">George Shrinks</a> because of <a href="http://jared.ottleys.net/general/andrew-whose-house-is-this" target="_blank">this post</a>).

One of the search terms that came up today through Feedburner was &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=jeos+initramfs" target="_blank">jeos initramfs</a>&#8220;. At first glance, I thought it was because of my post about <a href="http://jared.ottleys.net/alfresco/evaluating-with-a-virtual-appliance" target="_blank">building a virtual appliance</a>, but as it turned out, they all went to my post about <a href="http://jared.ottleys.net/alfresco/calling-all-open-source-cars" target="_blank">opportunities to help the Alfresco project by providing translations for other languages</a>. The &#8220;jeos initramfs&#8221; information was actually for a tweet <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jottley" target="_blank">I</a> posted on <a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">twitter</a>.

What this provides me, is a place to start learning more of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization" target="_blank">Search Engine Optimization</a> (you can always learn a new <a href="http://jared.ottleys.net/resume" target="_blank">skill</a>) and reminds me I need to post the information that I learned when I ran into problems with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeos" target="_blank">jeos</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initramfs#Initramfs_in_comparison_with_initrd" target="_blank">initramfs</a>.
