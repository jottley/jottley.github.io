We are back at the Hospital. Lots of cramping, pressure and a bit of spotting. She is still at 3cm and about 60% effaced. They will monitor of an hour and check again.

UPDATE:  We are back home.  No changes during the hour she was being monitored.  We have to go back tomorrow for her to be monitored for an hour or so again.
