Went to see [Charlie and the Chocolate Factory][1] on Saturday. For the most part I think we all liked it. [Johnny Depp][2] has once again proved himself one of the best actors of our time. I do have to say though, that I left feeling somewhat unsatisfied&#8230;.I wish that it was darker and there needed to be more conflict. I think that the earlier version of the [movie][3] provided me with a little more of that than the new version. (Wonka freaking out at Charlie, going through the tunnel, Wonka&#8217;s spaced out look as he gives some of his dialog.) I could have done without the father thing with Willy Wonka in the new version. I couldn&#8217;t have cared less about how he became who he was.
