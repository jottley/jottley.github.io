I have never seen [*Super Size Me*][1] (it is now in my Blockbuster queue), but I have to say that I am already a huge fan of [Morgan Spurlok][2]. I watched the premier of his new show on [FX][3], [30 Days][4]. I was blown away. It brought back up the reasons why I became a Democrat. Minimum Wage, Health Care, Education, etc. It is a genius idea for a show&#8230;30 days doing something and the effects it has on the people who do them. Minimum Wage was the premier. It is not just Morgan Spurlock, but others who will be the main characters in their own stories of discovery. I look forward to seeing them all. So you know where I will be every Wednesday night, and why I will not be answering the phone if you call.
