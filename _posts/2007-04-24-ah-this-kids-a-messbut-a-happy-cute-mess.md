After Adrienne had left for work, I snapped a few quick pics of Sawyer. <div align="center">
  <table style="width: 194px">
    <tr>
      <td style="height: 194px" align="center">
        <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jottley/FutureFireman"><img src="http://lh4.google.com/image/jottley/Ri2qE44kXqE/AAAAAAAAAW0/-QXuYAZPp08/s160-c/FutureFireman.jpg" style="margin: 1px 0pt 0pt 4px" height="160" width="160" /></a>
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;font-family: arial,sans-serif;font-size: 11px">
        <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jottley/FutureFireman">Future Fireman</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

Later I took a few more&#8230;After he got into the water colors and glue. <div align="center">
  <table style="width: 194px">
    <tr>
      <td style="height: 194px" align="center">
        <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jottley/WhatAMess"><img src="http://lh6.google.com/image/jottley/Ri2qyY4kXwE/AAAAAAAAAWw/BEKQfLJ0NJo/s160-c/WhatAMess.jpg" style="margin: 1px 0pt 0pt 4px" height="160" width="160" /></a>
      </td>
    </tr>
    
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center;font-family: arial,sans-serif;font-size: 11px">
        <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/jottley/WhatAMess">What a mess</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

And yes, I stuck him in the tub with his cloths on. It cleaned up very easily. But it sure scared the crap out of me. Adrienne would have killed me if it hadn&#8217;t. I was on the phone with her when I saw it. She wanted to know what happened. I told her she would find out later. I wanted to blog it after she went to sleep and before I left for work. This way she could only yell at me over the phone. <img src="http://jared.ottleys.net/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
