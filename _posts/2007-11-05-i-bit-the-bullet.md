This last week I did something I thought I wouldn&#8217;t do. I signed up for a <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a> account. Why? Partly to see what the hype is about. Partly because <a href="http://www.alfresco.com" target="_blank">we</a> are starting to do some work around and with Facebook.

So far, I am OK with Facebook. I haven&#8217;t had to experience a lot of the silliness that deterred me in the first place. (throwing food, biting people, turning them into zombies, etc.)

(The image is linked to join.)

You can also find in the Alfresco <a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Alfresco_SVN_Development_Environment#Subversion_Repository_Access" target="_blank">dev</a> <a href="https://svn.alfresco.com/repos/alfresco-open-mirror/" target="_blank">tree</a> work that we started on a <a href="//wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Facebook" target="_blank">Facebook-alfresco integration</a>. You can upload and share your content stored in Alfresco with your Facebook friends from within Facebook.
