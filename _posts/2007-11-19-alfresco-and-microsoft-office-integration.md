It is not just cool because it allows you to work from Word, Excel and PowerPoint directly in Alfresco, but because it is an excellent example of <a href="http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Web_Scripts" target="_blank">Web Scripts</a> in action. The add-on is actually launching a web browser that hooks into these MS Office Applications. Web Scripts are a powerful integration point for Alfresco. (Search <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=alfresco+web+scripts" target="_blank">here</a> for write ups on Web Scripts.)

The Alfresco add-in allows you to:

> > > > 
> > > 
> 
> browse the repository



> search within the repository



> open, save, delete content



> access version history and compare versions



> transform documents to PDFs



> start workflows



> insert documents into an existing document (think of a folder with documents that are actually standard response to RFP or RFI questions, you can insert these responses directly into the RFP/RFI using the add-in.).

> > > > 

Alfresco is normally a zero-foot print install on the client side (You use your browser and/or mapped drive into the repository.) But this is really worth the 6MB for the whole bundle.
